2	Rudolph Agnew , 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC , was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate .
10	Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
12	Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
13	The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
17	The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
21	The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
23	More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
28	Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
30	`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
35	Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
44	Typically , money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
47	It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
53	Pacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $ 27 a share , or $ 212 million .
54	The thrift holding company said it expects to obtain regulatory approval and complete the transaction by year-end .
58	It employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $ 370 million .
63	The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
65	Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp .
66	In the new position he will oversee Mazda 's U.S. sales , service , parts and marketing operations .
68	He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years .
69	When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .
72	And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
74	On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
75	For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge .
76	Champagne and dessert followed .
77	The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
79	A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
80	Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race .
81	After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
84	This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
85	Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
90	Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export-oriented economy .
92	South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
97	Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
99	Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
105	The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 .
107	`` What matters is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said Mr. Spoon .
108	Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches .
113	New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer .
114	The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company .
115	New England Electric , based in Westborough , Mass. , had offered $ 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth .
116	United Illuminating is based in New Haven , Conn. , and Northeast is based in Hartford , Conn .
118	John Rowe , president and chief executive officer of New England Electric , said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true .
119	`` When we evaluated raising our bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .
129	Northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court .
131	Norman Ricken , 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys `` R '' Us Inc. , and Frederick Deane Jr. , 63 , chairman of Signet Banking Corp. , were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain .
132	They succeed Daniel M. Rexinger , retired Circuit City executive vice president , and Robert R. Glauber , U.S. Treasury undersecretary , on the 12-member board .
133	Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund about $ 250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant .
134	The refund was about $ 55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility .
136	Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison .
138	Commonwealth Edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry 's order .
141	For 1988 , Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million , or $ 3.01 a share .
146	But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal .
147	The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses .
149	In August , the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded , plus interest .
157	Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said .
158	The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September .
164	The new plant , located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul , will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea , the company said .
165	The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances .
166	The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray .
168	Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped .
173	`` The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 , and without him it could not be completed .
181	`` You either believe Seymour can do it again or you do n't . ''
183	The SEC documents describe those chips , which are made of gallium arsenide , as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment .
185	Cray Computer also will face intense competition , not only from Cray Research , which has about 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray-3 , in 1991 .
186	The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan 's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd .
187	The new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range .
195	Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted .
200	Besides Messrs. Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer ; Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering ; Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software ; and Douglas R. Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware .
203	John R. Stevens , 49 years old , was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer , both new positions .
204	He will continue to report to Donald Pardus , president and chief executive officer .
212	The U.S. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual-property rights .
213	However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced .
214	Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring .
216	She said there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . ''
217	U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there .
218	Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates .
220	Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films .
222	Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said .
225	Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list .
226	Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia .
229	Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . ''
230	She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey .
238	Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks .
239	Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem , who took office July 8 , feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved .
243	That year the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market .
245	Apple II owners , for example , had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes .
246	But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club .
248	Crude as they were , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office .
250	But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories .
251	Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .
253	William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 .
255	Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone .
260	Faulding said it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 % .
263	Esso Australia Ltd. , a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture .
268	The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year , and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year .
270	R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $ 10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit 's president , Thomas R. Sloan , and other managers .
273	The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in `` significant quantities '' in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions .
277	The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . ''
278	Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences .
279	U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
281	Magna International Inc. 's chief financial officer , James McAlpine , resigned and its chairman , Frank Stronach , is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around , the company said .
282	Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending `` until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained , '' Magna said .
284	An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .
286	Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 13.73 -RRB- .
288	Mr. Stronach , founder and controlling shareholder of Magna , resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek , unsuccessfully , a seat in Canada 's Parliament .
291	The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring , assisted by Manfred Gingl , president and chief executive .
292	Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment .
298	The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
301	The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co .
302	The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .
303	First , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates .
305	By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . ''
306	Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate .
309	LTV Corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until March 8 , 1990 , the period in which the steel , aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan .
315	Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in October to $ 84.29 billion , the Finance Ministry said .
321	No fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year , triple the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co. , a Washington-based research firm .
329	The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London .
334	And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it .
335	Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities .
336	And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan .
339	Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .
341	When the stock market dropped nearly 7 % Oct. 13 , for instance , the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % .
344	After trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 % .
352	Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds .
354	Nonetheless , plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds .
358	The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government , the State Department said .
362	The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July .
364	Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , as amended , it 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
369	In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September .
377	Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .
378	The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation .
411	Although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn .
421	When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise .
423	Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
425	It found that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in October and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month .
426	While acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''
427	Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder .
436	Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .
437	They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
438	They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
444	It 's imaginative and often funny .
447	Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin .
451	Their books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana .
453	As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''
454	`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .
455	A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .
457	But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .
459	Despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home .
464	It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility .
465	All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman .
466	But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony .
468	Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too .
471	In Singapore , a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 fine .
472	Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban , and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours , an official said .
473	Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast-food restaurants .
474	In Malaysia , Siti Zaharah Sulaiman , a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office , launched a `` No-Smoking Week '' at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking .
476	In Seoul , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .
477	South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
479	The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the U.S. and Japan .
480	The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S. .
481	More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan .
482	The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .
483	The meeting , which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion .
486	An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year .
487	The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization .
490	Once the disease was confirmed , all the man 's associates and family were tested , but none have so far been found to have AIDS , the newspaper said .
492	The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices .
493	The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .
498	Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned .
509	Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , both Toronto-based investment dealers .
513	But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way .
519	Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would .
521	Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign .
522	On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs .
523	The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers .
526	He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to .
531	This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse .
532	She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .
534	To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building .
537	He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force .
538	The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices .
541	Yet this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government 's hypocrisy .
542	While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor .
544	She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies .
545	She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client .
546	Her remorse was shallow and brief .
547	Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home .
548	As presented by Mr. Chabrol , and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie-Louise -LRB- called Marie Latour in the film -RRB- was not a nice person .
551	Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory .
552	I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die .
555	The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd .
557	Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program .
562	`` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . ''
563	A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage .
564	`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
567	Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :
571	And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
572	Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''
575	Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
585	It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .
586	Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
587	He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
591	But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
594	They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''
597	Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
598	Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . ''
599	That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
600	The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad .
601	The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
603	Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
605	Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
606	The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
607	`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
608	`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''
609	Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
612	The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter .
615	And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
616	Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. Courter 's -RCB- property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''
618	The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes .
621	`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . ''
624	Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate .
625	Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
630	Seats currently are quoted at $ 331,000 , bid , and $ 350,000 , asked .
633	Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades .
634	But Japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .
638	Japan 's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .
639	Asia 's other cash-rich countries are following Japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region .
640	In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production .
641	These nations , known as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to Southeast Asia 's integration , but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan 's .
642	For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth .
649	In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world .
651	These nations ' internal decisions `` will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender , '' says Richard Drobnick , director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California 's Graduate School of Business .
654	Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University .
655	In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia .
656	`` The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats .
657	Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
658	The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .
659	Participants will include the U.S. , Australia , Canada , Japan , South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei .
671	The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea .
673	`` No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home , '' Mr. Hormats says .
674	For their part , Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut .
675	`` They do n't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says Chong-sik Lee , professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania .
678	She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny .
679	`` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... .
681	The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms . ''
682	Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking .
684	The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest .
686	The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school .
687	Confronted , Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes .
688	She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .
689	Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
690	In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine .
693	She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again .
694	In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr .
695	Mrs. Yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat .
699	`` There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores , '' says Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College .
708	These materials , including Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .
709	By using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers .
710	Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County , Mrs. Yeargin 's school district .
712	Under the state 's Education Improvement Act , low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching , state-supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings .
713	High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent .
718	Says the organization 's founder , John Cannell , prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''
719	Paul Sandifer , director of testing for the South Carolina department of education , says Mr. Cannell 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences .
722	Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city , the school has educated many of South Carolina 's best and brightest , including the state 's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward .
724	`` It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , '' says Linda Ward , the school 's principal .
725	`` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''
729	Academically , Mrs. Ward says , the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run-down , inner city neighborhoods .
730	Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .
731	One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment .
732	Another was Nancy Yeargin , who came to Greenville in 1985 , full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward .
735	I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students . ''
736	While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite .
737	In 1986-87 and 1987-88 , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law .
739	She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . ''
741	She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher .
744	In the classroom , students say , Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions .
745	On weekends , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom .
748	Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students .
755	Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 .
757	But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition .
761	When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students .
762	Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
769	`` A whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .
772	School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying .
783	She says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
788	To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support .
789	The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .
792	`` The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state , '' said the talk-show host .
793	Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .
795	Partly because of the show , Mr. Watson says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record .
804	`` We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''
805	But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
808	Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges .
812	These days , students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests .
814	It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths .
816	In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials .
817	What 's more , the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company , Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill , a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp .
818	Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say .
819	Test-preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry .
821	`` If I took -LCB- these preparation booklets -RCB- into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher who has studied test coaching .
822	He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress .
823	`` It 's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class , and when everybody aces the test , they say their kids are good in European history , '' says John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which has studied standardized testing .
825	The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan\/McGraw 's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills , by Houghton Mifflin Co. ; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test .
826	Sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known , but their reach into schools is significant .
827	In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say they are common classroom tools .
831	Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests .
835	Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test .
837	Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures .
841	Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
842	Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format . ''
843	He said authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar .
846	In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw-Hill said Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests .
848	Messrs. Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High .
851	New York-based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern .
853	The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants .
854	Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's .
857	He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
859	Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President Bush , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened .
861	The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
862	A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .
863	The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
864	Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants .
866	Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
868	Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
874	`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said .
876	`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary .
878	Rekindled hope that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq 's bank stocks , but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading .
886	The bank stocks got a boost when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks .

922	The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 .
923	The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment .
929	`` The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail .
933	Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said .
936	Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .
937	Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .
938	At that meeting , he said , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .
942	A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .
945	Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
946	But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
950	Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif .
953	`` A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview .
957	You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .
960	The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high-priced lawyer . ''
962	Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $ 11 million , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .
965	The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988 .
966	In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .
968	He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .
971	Mr. Samnick , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified .
972	In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau .
975	A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals .
976	The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''
978	The panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women .
981	The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''
983	Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. Murray concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .
984	Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
988	In an eight-count indictment , the government has charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , specialty chemical maker , and its Vice Chairman James T.

1000	Meanwhile , business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing .
1002	The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract .
1005	In both cases , NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery .
1006	All the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software .
1007	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman .
1008	`` These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , '' a ministry statement said .
1014	But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny .
1020	The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make .
1023	The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen -LRB- $ 77,000 -RRB- , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free .
1025	It also said that in July , it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library , and two years ago , it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture .
1026	The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano .
1028	Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge .
1029	Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday .

1053	In September , the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $ 2 million to $ 3 million net loss for the third quarter .
1055	`` Over the summer months , there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector , our primary market , '' said Wilfred J. Corrigan , chairman and chief executive officer .
1057	As a result , the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and `` make appropriate reductions '' in operating expenses .
1059	Not counting the extraordinary charge , the company said it would have had a net loss of $ 3.1 million , or seven cents a share .
1060	A year earlier , it had profit of $ 7.5 million , or 18 cents a share .
1063	Related to that decision , the company said it was converting its Santa Clara , Calif. , factory to a research and development facility .
1065	`` This is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned , '' said Michael Stark , chip analyst at Robertson , Stephens & Co .

1073	While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators , dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark .
1076	`` Dollar-yen -LCB- trade -RCB- is the driving force in the market , '' said Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York , `` but I 'm not convinced it will continue .
1078	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks , up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday , and at 143.80 yen , up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday .
1081	Douglas Madison , a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles , traced the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings .
1083	He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence .
1087	They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede .
1088	The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy , and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators .
1090	The managers ' index , which measures the health of the manufacturing sector , stood at 47.6 % in October , above September 's 46 % , and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3 % .
1091	Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50 , which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy .
1096	`` The Cosby Show '' may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984 , and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network .
1098	The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows .
1099	But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire .
1100	Meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , Viacom Inc. , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` Cosby '' to a competitor .
1110	And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence , R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh , N.C. ; Minneapolis , and Louisville , Ky. , say they may very well not renew `` Cosby . ''
1114	Neil Kuvin , the general manager of WHAS , the CBS affiliate in Louisville , says `` Cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . ''
1115	But he adds , `` I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with Viacom .
1119	In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars , a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space .
1123	The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders .
1124	Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys .
1127	With only two issues under its belt , Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others .
1129	The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable .
1131	`` I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage , '' fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup .
1137	`` You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it , '' says Mike White , senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham , Chicago .
1139	The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers , including General Electric and Adolph Coors , but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International , firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul .
1140	A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues .
1142	But Ms. Poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , contends Garbage can survive , at least initially , on subscription revenues .
1143	Individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 .
1145	According to Ms. Poore , Old-House Journal Corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue .
1146	The first and second issues sold out on newsstands , she says , and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions .
1147	Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy , Ms. Poore replies : `` I do n't know and I do n't care .
1148	I 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important , '' she says , `` but I could n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad .
1152	It said the programs , largely game shows , will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International , a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49 % .
1154	Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time , which it said will be valued at more than $ 75 million in 1990 and $ 150 million in 1991 .
1165	Developed by Avrett , Free & Ginsberg , New York , the $ 6 million campaign pitches Enterprise 's consumer-driven service and its free pick-up and drop-off service .
1169	Ketchum Communications , Pittsburgh , acquired Braun & Co. , a Los Angeles investor-relations and marketing-communications firm .
1172	Sea Containers , a Hamilton , Bermuda-based shipping concern , said Tuesday that it would sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece .
1173	The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC .
1174	In May , the two companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple , offered $ 50 a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers .
1175	In August , Temple sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million .
1182	Temple , however , harshly criticized Sea Containers ' plan yesterday , characterizing it as a `` highly conditional device designed to entrench management , confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer . ''
1184	The lower figures , the spokesman said , would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market .
1185	Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda , where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook .
1187	Temple also said Sea Containers ' plan raises `` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , '' but did n't elaborate .
1190	The Transportation Department , responding to pressure from safety advocates , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles .
1191	The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans , beginning with 1992 models .
1192	It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year .
1194	`` Today 's action , '' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said , `` represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards . ''
1195	In September , the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars .
1196	The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans .
1197	Safety advocates , including some members of Congress , have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. .
1198	They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars .
1204	Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans , including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection .
1208	In Detroit , a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year .
1210	Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars .
1220	Bank of New England Corp. said it has held talks with potential merger partners outside New England , although it added that nothing is imminent and it has n't received any formal offers .
1221	The discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in Connecticut and in Massachusetts .
1223	Currently , both Massachusetts and Connecticut , where most of Bank of New England 's operations are , allow interstate banking only within New England .
1225	We have , and I 'm sure others have , considered what our options are , and we 've had conversations with people who in the future might prove to be interesting partners . ''
1227	Mr. Driscoll did n't elaborate about who the potential partners were or when the talks were held .
1228	A bank spokeswoman also declined to comment on any merger-related matters , but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because `` prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage . ''
1229	Bank of New England has been hit hard by the region 's real-estate slump , with its net income declining 42 % to $ 121.6 million , or 61 cents a share , in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period .
1230	The company recently said it would sell some operations and lay off 4 % of its work force , altogether reducing employment to less than 16,000 from about 18,000 .
1234	The Kearny , N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $ 992,000 , or 15 cents a share .
1235	In the year-ago quarter , the company reported net income of $ 1.9 million , or 29 cents a share .
1237	Michael Henderson , 51-year-old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker , will become chairman in May , succeeding Ian Butler , 64 , who is retiring .
1242	Giant Group is led by three Rally 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II , who last month indicated they hold a 42.5 % stake in Rally 's and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board .
1243	When Warren Winiarski , proprietor of Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley , announced a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked .
1244	`` This is the peak of my wine-making experience , '' Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York , `` and I wanted to single it out as such . ''
1245	It is in my estimation the best wine Stag 's Leap has produced , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly .
1246	The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest .
1248	One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -LRB- or so perceived , at any rate -RRB- , and with exceedingly high prices .
1249	For years , this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths -LRB- Lafite-Rothschild , Latour , Haut-Brion , Petrus -RRB- , Grand Cru Burgundies -LRB- Romanee-Conti and La Tache -RRB- deluxe Champagnes -LRB- Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal -RRB- , rarefied sweet wines -LRB- Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany -RRB- .
1252	The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe .
1254	Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -LRB- except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which costs around $ 250 ! -RRB- .
1260	Roederer Cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level .
1267	From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $ 125 a bottle , Piero Antinori 's La Solaia , a $ 90 Cabernet from Tuscany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $ 98 .
1272	Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines , Mr. Shapiro continued : `` We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle .
1275	It 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -LRB- the last was 1979 -RRB- and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 .
1276	Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle , but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter .
1277	Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -LRB- $ 100 retail -RRB- , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -RRB- no , the wine is too high -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- yes , it 's high but I 'll take it -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- I 'll take all I can get -LRB- 58 responses -RRB- .
1278	The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states .
1279	`` We thought it was awfully expensive , '' said Sterling Pratt , wine director at Schaefer 's in Skokie , Ill. , one of the top stores in suburban Chicago , `` but there are people out there with very different opinions of value .
1280	We got our two six-packs -- and they 're gone . ''
1283	`` There may be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' said Mr. Pratt , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . ''
1285	`` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace -LCB- one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets -RCB- or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus .
1286	Producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . ''
1290	`` Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . ''
1291	Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines -LRB- like Grgich Hills Chardonnay , now $ 32 -RRB- just to slow down movement , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range .
1292	Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced .
1293	Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 .
1294	It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as Mr. Pratt noted , people have their own ideas about value .
1296	In every major market in the U.S. , for instance , you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux -LRB- except Petrus -RRB- , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and , at the moment , the Stag 's Leap 1985 Cask 23 .
1300	Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so .
1304	Nevertheless , both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern .
1306	Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well .
1307	`` I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date , '' said Robert Johnson , vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co .
1308	The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75 % after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , but has shown no sign of movement since .
1311	And in the Chicago district , the report said , `` a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . ''
1312	Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts , particularly `` for discretionary , big-ticket items such as furniture , home appliances and consumer electronics . ''
1316	Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move .
1317	Mr. Black said he is `` pleased '' with the economy 's recent performance , and does n't see `` a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession . ''
1318	`` There is always a chance of recession , '' added Mr. Guffey , `` but if you ask me to put a percentage on it , I would think it 's well below a 50 % chance .
1319	Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $ 9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week .
1321	Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $ 100 face amount of 13.5 % bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share .
1323	Integra , which owns and operates hotels , said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that are n't exercised by other shareholders .
1326	The previous contract between Copperweld 's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday .
1330	The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 30 billion in notes and bonds next week , but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .
1331	Michael Basham , deputy assistant secretary for federal finance , said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .
1336	`` To avoid these costs , and a possible default , immediate action is imperative . ''
1337	The securities to be sold next week will raise about $ 10 billion in cash and redeem $ 20 billion in maturing notes .
1339	-- $ 10 billion of three-year notes , to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15 , 1992 .
1340	-- $ 10 billion of 10-year notes , to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15 , 1999 .
1341	-- $ 10 billion of 30-year bonds , to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15 , 2019 .
1346	Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $ 25.6 billion .
1347	The remaining $ 21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills , two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December , the Treasury said .
1348	In the first three months of 1990 , the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion , assuming that it decides to aim for a $ 10 billion cash balance at the end of March .
1351	Reames , a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive , Iowa , has annual sales of about $ 11 million , Lancaster said .
1353	Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly .
1360	But with the end of the year in sight , money managers are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in
1368	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 of face amount .
1371	In late afternoon New York trading the currency was at 1.8500 marks and 143.80 yen compared with 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen .
1376	Pacific Sierra , based in Los Angeles , has about 200 employees and supplies professional services and advanced products to industry .
1377	Eaton is an automotive parts , controls and aerospace electronics concern .
1378	Investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries Inc. offered to acquire Georgia Gulf Corp. for $ 50 a share , or about $ 1.1 billion , stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern .
1379	The offer follows an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $ 55 a share .
1380	Georgia Gulf rebuffed that offer in September and said it would study other alternatives .
1383	Georgia Gulf said it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are being held with interested parties , and work is also continuing on other various transactions . ''
1385	Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons , an aggressive and persistent investor , wo n't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed .
1388	Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9 % stake in Georgia Gulf .
1392	Georgia Gulf stock rose $ 1.75 a share yesterday to close at $ 51.25 a share , while NL shares closed unchanged at $ 22.75 and Valhi rose 62.5 cents to $ 15 , all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
1393	J. Landis Martin , NL president and chief executive officer , said NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $ 250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt .
1395	Now , he said , the group plans to put in `` several hundred million '' dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt .
1398	It was n't clear how NL and Mr. Simmons would respond if Georgia Gulf spurns them again .
1399	Mr. Martin said they have n't yet decided what their next move would be , but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf 's board .
1401	Although Georgia Gulf has n't been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL , a specialty chemicals concern , the group apparently believes the company 's management is interested in some kind of transaction .
1402	The management group owns about 18 % of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold .
1403	In the third quarter , Georgia Gulf earned $ 46.1 million , or $ 1.85 a share , down from $ 53 million , or $ 1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding .
1406	University Patents Inc. , based in Westport , Conn. , said it seeks Johnson & Johnson 's profits from sales of Retin-A , estimated at $ 50 million , a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere .
1407	In May , University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman , a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne .
1408	Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University , but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson .
1412	Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. .
1416	The Japanese `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , '' says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders .
1421	`` We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests -LCB- in the U.S. . -RCB- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people , '' said the spokesman , Taizo Watanabe .
1423	Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller Group , the owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's most exclusive real estate .
1430	While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks .
1431	Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .
1434	`` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring , '' Mr. Dallara says .
1439	`` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official .
1443	Since then , a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices .
1449	For Japan , the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology .
1450	But for small American companies , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help .
1454	It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions .
1458	Indeed , for many Japanese trading companies , the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use .
1459	The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch .
1460	Japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized U.S. firms for years , but in recent months , the pace has taken off .
1467	As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge , they feed American anxieties in this area , too .
1470	Last year , Mitsubishi International Corp. , the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant .
1476	Trading companies such as Mitsubishi , Mitsui , C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho-Iwai Corp. , which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns , have no U.S. counterpart .
1477	These vertically integrated combines , some of which got their start in Japan 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .
1478	They operate ships and banks .
1486	`` People are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic .
1490	Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35 % interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990 .
1493	Hudson General Corp. 's president and chief executive officer , Alan J. Stearn , resigned .
1496	Hudson General , which provides maintenance , fueling and other services to airlines and airports , reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares .
1497	Mr. Stearn , who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984 , will act as a consultant to Hudson General .
1500	A high-balance customer that banks pine for , she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying .
1502	Among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans .
1503	All she had to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit .
1507	For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .
1510	Instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population .
1513	The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money .
1514	In September , Union Planters Corp. of Memphis , Tenn. , launched The Edge account , a package designed for the `` thirtysomething '' crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans .
1519	`` Varying age , geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' Ms. MacDonald says .
1520	She says individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests .
1523	In 1973 , Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee .
1524	The concept begot a slew of copycats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages .
1526	Many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable .
1528	But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography .
1531	Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits .
1532	The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation .
1533	`` Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional and money-center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts and credit unions , '' says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research .
1537	`` This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today 's rate-sensitive customers costly . ''
1543	The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive .
1545	`` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' Mr. Jacob says .
1553	SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares .
1556	ShareData develops and markets low-cost software , peripheral equipment and accessories for computers .
1564	But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise .
1565	Your $ 15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit .
1570	At the same time , you 'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good .
1571	As a Foster Corporate Parent , you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass , Lewis Ranieri , William Simon and others , who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves .
1575	Think about the good you can do for just $ 15,000 a month , about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university .
1576	Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .
1577	Every $ 15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit !
1580	Separately , John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies .
1584	With the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it .
1585	The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well .
1589	But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized .
1598	In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. Phelan , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal `` providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill .
1599	The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
1600	SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs .
1601	A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . ''
1607	That response annoyed Rep. Markey , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
1608	Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. John Dingell -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months .
1611	The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
1615	The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
1616	In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
1618	Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
1621	They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
1623	`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''
1624	Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .
1632	Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
1633	Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
1634	A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .
1637	No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
1638	Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
1639	Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
1640	Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
1641	In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
1643	`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
1646	When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
1648	With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
1657	Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .
1661	It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''
1662	Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''
1665	Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches .
1666	But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
1670	The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
1671	This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
1672	One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''
1673	In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
1681	Strong dividend growth , he says , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating .
1682	Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund , explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time .
1687	The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 , and fell 12 % in 1977 -- despite a 15 % expansion in dividends that year .
1688	That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious .
1689	Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % .
1692	As a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards .
1700	There 's never been an exception , '' says Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago investment adviser and money manager , based on a review of six decades of stock-market data .
1702	Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle .
1703	There have been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive months , Mr. Perritt found .
1707	In particular , Mr. Coxon says , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically .
1713	Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .
1717	Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs .
1718	Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures .
1724	Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak .
1726	`` Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says .
1727	With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels .
1730	Bell 's father-in-law , Gardner G. Hubbard , wealthy and well-connected , obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston , which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York .
1733	It acquired Thomas Edison 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather , Emile Berliner , which had been sold to Bell for a princely $ 50,000 , infringed upon Western Union 's Edison patent .
1734	When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison 's application , Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight .
1736	Troubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations .
1737	The ailing company , which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters , said it wo n't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force .
1738	Altogether , NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters , 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters .
1740	Stephen G. Jerritts , president and chief executive officer , said customers were n't willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company 's financial troubles .
1743	`` We had to do something structurally and radically different . ''
1744	As a result , he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems , trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business , using some of the applications it developed for its hardware .
1746	The company , which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock , said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash .
1748	It was Richard Nixon 's first visit to China in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington .
1755	Instead , Mr. Nixon reminded his host , Chinese President Yang Shangkun , that Americans have n't forgiven China 's leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators .
1756	`` Many in the United States , including many friends of China , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang , who was directly involved in ordering the attack .
1757	`` The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China . ''
1759	In talks with Mr. Nixon , Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring .
1760	In a meeting Tuesday , supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , told Mr. Nixon , `` Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago .
1761	China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it . ''
1762	Despite the harsh exchanges , the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as `` the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations '' since his initial visit to China 17 years ago .
1764	Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7 , when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife , Li Shuxian , took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing .
1766	Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration .
1767	Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , before coming to China on Saturday .
1771	These included China 's economic policies , human rights and the question of Mr. Fang .
1774	In his talks , the former president urged China 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas .
1775	`` Ideas are going over borders , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday .
1781	But the guards there retained their pistols , and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars .
1782	Moreover , police and soldiers continue to harass Americans , who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week .
1783	Several times , Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger .
1791	Money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work .
1793	Unfortunately , Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages .
1795	I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers , but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them .
1796	Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images , but they should realize that the most important thing is real change , not changing people 's perceptions .
1797	If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival , they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; improve working conditions -LRB- better offices and more vacations , for example -RRB- ; accept and hire more labor from outside Japan .
1803	The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush 's job performance and 85 % of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush .
1804	If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy .
1806	Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .
1808	The National Association of Securities Dealers , the self-regulatory organization for the over-the-counter securities markets , disciplined a number of firms and individuals for alleged violations of industry rules .
1809	Two firms were expelled from the NASD , three were suspended or barred and nine were fined .
1810	First Securities Group of California and a principal of the firm , Louis Fernando Vargas of Marina del Rey , Calif. , were jointly fined $ 15,000 and expelled for alleged violations of reporting requirements on securities sales .
1812	Neither First Securities , of Beverly Hills , nor Mr. Vargas could be reached for comment .
1814	J.L. Henry & Co. , Miami , and a principal of the firm , Henry I. Otero of Miami , were jointly fined $ 30,000 and expelled , for alleged improper use of a customer 's funds , among other things .
1818	Biscayne Securities Corp. , of Lauderhill , Fla. , and a principal of the firm , Alvin Rosenblum of Plantation , Fla. , were jointly fined $ 20,000 and given 10-day suspensions for allegedly selling securities at unfair prices .
1821	Triton Securities , of Danville , Calif. , and a principal of the firm , Delwin George Chase , also of Danville , were jointly fined $ 10,000 and given 30-day suspensions as part of a settlement .
1822	While neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing , Triton and Mr. Chase consented to findings of violations in connection with limited-partnership sales .
1825	Crane & Co. Securities Inc. , of Mount Clemens , Mich. , and its president , Glenn R. Crane , of Sterling Heights , Mich. , consented to a joint fine of $ 10,000 .
1826	Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings of violations of escrow and record-keeping rules .
1828	First Commonwealth Securities Corp. , of New Orleans , and its president , Kenneth J. Canepa , also of New Orleans , consented to a $ 10,000 fine .
1830	Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings that they had inaccurately represented the firm 's net capital , maintained inaccurate books and records , and made other violations .
1831	Mr. Canepa confirmed he had consented to the sanctions but declined to comment further .
1832	Weatherly Securities Corp. , New York , and three of its principals -- Dell Eugene Keehn and William Northy Prater Jr. , both of Mercer Island , Wash. , and Thomas Albert McFall , of Red Bank , N.J . -- consented to a fine of $ 20,000 .
1833	Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings that they failed to return funds owed to customers in connection with a limited-partnership offering .
1834	Reached at his office , Mr. McFall , currently chairman , said , `` An implication that we failed to return investor funds is inappropriate and inaccurate . ''
1836	W.N. Whelen & Co. , of Georgetown , Del. , and its president , William N. Whelen Jr. , also of Georgetown , were barred from transacting principal trades for 90 days and were jointly fined $ 15,000 .
1837	The firm and Mr. Whelen allegedly sold securities to the public at unfair prices , among other alleged violations .
1838	Mr. Whelen denied the firm had sold securities at unfair prices and suggested that the examination practices of the NASD need improvement .
1839	The firm and the NASD differ over the meaning of markup and markdown , he added .
1841	Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , the firm consented to findings that it failed to respond `` in a timely manner '' to the NASD 's requests for information in connection with a customer complaint .
1843	The following individuals were fined as indicated and barred from association with NASD members , or , where noted , suspended .
1844	Except where noted , none of these people could be reached for comment or had any comment .
1845	Andrew Derel Adams , Killeen , Texas , fined $ 15,000 ; John Francis Angier Jr. , Reddington Shores , Fla. , $ 15,000 ; Mark Anthony , Arlington Heights , Ill. , $ 10,000 and 30-day suspension ; William Stirlen , Arlington Heights , Ill. , $ 7,500 and 30-day suspension ; Fred W. Bonnell , Boulder , Colo. , $ 2,500 and six-month suspension ; Michael J. Boorse , Horsham , Pa. ; David Chiodo , Dallas , $ 5,000 , barred as a principal ; Camille Chafic Cotran , London , $ 25,000 ; John William Curry , fined $ 5,000 , ordered to disgorge $ 30,000 , one-year suspension .
1846	John William Davis , Colonsville , Miss. , fined $ 200,000 ; Jeffrey Gerard Dompierre , Valrico , Fla. , $ 5,000 and 10-day suspension ; Eugene Michael Felten , La Canada , Calif. , fined $ 25,000 , ordered to disgorge $ 16,072 and suspended one year ; Marion Stewart Spitler , La Canada , fined $ 15,000 , ordered to disgorge $ 18,444 and suspended six months .
1847	Mr. Felten said , `` We got what amounted to a parking ticket , and by complaining about it , we ended up with a sizable fine and suspension . ''
1849	Victor Stanley Fishman , Longwood , Fla. , fined $ 25,000 ; William Harold Floyd , Houston , $ 100,000 ; Michael Anthony Houston , Bronx , N.Y. , $ 15,000 ; Amin Jalaalwalikraam , Glenham , N.Y. , $ 60,000 ; Richard F. Knapp , London , $ 10,000 and 30-day suspension ; Deborah Renee Martin , St. Louis , $ 15,000 ; Joseph Francis Muscolina Jr. , Palisades Park , N.J. , $ 15,000 ; Robert C. Najarian , Brooklyn Park , Minn. , $ 15,000 ; Edward Robert Norwick , Nesconset , N.Y. , $ 30,000 .
1850	Charles D. Phipps Sr. , Hermitage , Pa. , fined $ 10,000 ; David Scott Rankin , Lake St. Louis , Mo. , $ 15,000 ; Leigh A. Sanderoff , Gaithersburg , Md. , fined $ 45,000 , ordered to disgorge $ 12,252 ; Sandra Ann Smith , Ridgefield , N.J. , $ 15,000 ; James G.

Zayed , San Francisco , $ 50,000 .
1851	The following were neither barred nor suspended : Stephanie Veselich Enright , Rolling Hills , Calif. , fined $ 2,500 and ordered to disgorge $ 11,762 ; Stuart Lane Russel , Glendale , Calif. , fined $ 2,500 and ordered to disgorge $ 14,821 ; Devon Nilson Dahl , Fountain Valley , Calif. , fined $ 82,389 .
1853	`` Insurance agents have been forced by their companies into becoming registered reps , '' he said , `` but they are not providing compliance and security-type training so that we can avoid stupid mistakes . ''
1854	The following were barred or , where noted , suspended and consented to findings without admitting or denying wrongdoing : Edward L. Cole , Jackson , Miss. , $ 10,000 fine ; Rita Rae Cross , Denver , $ 2,500 fine and 30-day suspension ; Thomas Richard Meinders , Colorado Springs , Colo. , $ 2,000 fine , five-day suspension and eight-month suspension as a principal ; Ronald A.

Monchecourt , Las Vegas , $ 5,000 and one-year suspension ; and Robert Gerhard Smith , Carson City , Nev. , two-year suspension .
1859	But in London and Tokyo , where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role , traders say a number of hurdles loom .
1860	Government officials , especially in Japan , probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business .
1863	And because of the time difference , the Japanese and the U.S. markets ' trading hours do n't overlap .
1864	It all adds up to a barrier to American-style index arbitrage , the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks .
1868	Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year 's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges .
1871	Japan 's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .
1875	Some U.S. firms , notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage , both for customers and for their own accounts .
1877	Both Deryck C. Maughan , who heads Salomon in Tokyo , and John S. Wadsworth , who heads Morgan Stanley there , ascribe a good part of their firms ' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated , futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients .
1880	`` The real difference seems to be that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in America . ''
1886	First , the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes .
1888	In addition to the extra privacy of these trades , the transactions can often be less expensive to execute , because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee .
1895	This year , the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118 , up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984 .
1899	The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
1900	Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs .
1901	But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress , after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise .
1904	The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
1909	Adopting a training-wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. Roukema said .
1910	Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force .
1911	Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence .
1912	The compromise sets the training wage at $ 3.35 an hour next April , and at $ 3.61 an hour , or 85 % of the minimum wage , in April 1991 .
1913	Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days , without restriction , to workers with less than six months of job experience , and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers .
1916	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , still opposed to any mininum-wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 % in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 `` will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers .
1917	Zenith Data Systems Corp. , a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp. , received a $ 534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period .
1919	Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $ 29.9 million Air Force contract for low-altitude navigation and targeting equipment .
1921	For six years , T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle .
1923	Mr. Hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp .
1928	If a competitor enters the game , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival .
1929	Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold .
1930	`` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper .
1944	Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but friends say that 's an understatement .
1947	Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business .
1948	Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals .
1950	At the same time , he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new-home construction .
1958	It would be a good match , Mr. Hahn and many analysts say , of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows .
1963	A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
1964	For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package .
1965	The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration .
1966	The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget .
1967	These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .
1971	The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant .
1972	In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant .
1973	The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market .
1974	Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 .
1975	About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .
1976	The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados .
1977	Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye .
1978	Jamaica , wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray , but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the Philippines .
1979	In separate floor action , the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990 .
1980	The funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights .
1981	The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House , but in recent days , the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House .
1982	The most recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State , Justice and Commerce departments .
1985	EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
1989	`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .
1990	He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings .
1992	Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below .
1996	Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .
1999	PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims Scypher Corp. , the maker of the Cup-Tote .
2000	The Chicago company 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
2004	He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
2011	AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides .
2012	An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities .
2014	The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute .
2025	Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says .
2028	A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says .
2030	A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .
2031	The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants , and proposed $ 7.3 million in fines , the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer .
2032	The department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $ 6.1 million for alleged violations at the company 's Fairless Hills , Pa. , steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility .
2033	OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical , crane-safety , record-keeping and other requirements .
2034	A second citation covering the company 's Clairton , Pa. , coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements , for which OSHA proposed $ 1.2 million in fines .
2035	Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said , `` The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards . ''
2036	OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
2037	Gerard Scannell , the head of OSHA , said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards . ''
2040	A USX spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine .
2042	`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ''
2043	USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works .
2044	He said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected .
2047	`` The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia .
2048	USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission .
2053	Your Oct. 6 editorial `` The Ill Homeless '' referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
2054	Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .
2056	It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
2057	The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
2058	In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
2059	You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
2060	They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
2061	Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
2062	In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .
2063	The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . ''
2065	This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research .
2068	The study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
2069	According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level . ''
2071	To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York : `` If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered .
2073	Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction .
2075	Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?
2077	You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years .
2078	There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .
2081	Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive .
2082	But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?
2083	Why did n't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?
2085	Choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income .
2086	I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically .
2090	Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares , but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place .
2091	A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed , but will probably be set at around 8 % .
2094	The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor .
2095	The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto .
2099	`` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , -LRB- R. , Ark . -RRB- said .
2100	The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline .
2101	The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .
2102	The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio -LRB- D. , Ore. -RRB- that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits .
2105	On Tuesday , the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
2108	You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week .
2110	You can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress .
2118	The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people .
2119	That sounds neat , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day .
2121	Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint , and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue .
2122	The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd : An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform .
2124	Assuming it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , I 'll review the facts .
2125	The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world .
2129	The law let scholars , reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material , only at VOA headquarters in Washington , but it barred them from copying texts .
2132	`` You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying , '' a Voice official explained when I asked .
2133	What if I tune in my short-wave radio , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ?
2135	That sounded a lot like censorship , so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere , I sued .
2143	`` The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States , '' my lawyer , the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost .
2144	The court noted the new USIA position but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically . ''
2145	-- The USIA said that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute .
2146	`` The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials , '' Mr. McCormick noted .
2148	`` The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and , while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken , '' Mr. McCormick reported .
2149	I had sought , in my suit , the right to print Voice material , which had been denied me , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information .
2154	You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you do n't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours .
2155	I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand .
2156	But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us .
2157	In an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not , this does seem odd .
2158	Indeed , Judge O'Brien ruled that `` it would be easy to conclude that the USIA 's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid , ' '' but it 's the law .
2161	Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us -LRB- but now , thanks to the USIA 's new position , all of us -RRB- `` for examination only . ''
2162	If those words were n't there , the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it .
2164	`` You have ... raised important questions which ought to be answered : What does USIA say about America abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions ? '' a man wrote me a couple of years ago .
2171	Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune in Ames , Iowa , and president of NBC News in New York .
2172	R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co. 's president and chief executive officer , the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company .
2173	Herbert M. Baum , the 53-year-old president of the company 's Campbell U.S.A. unit , and Edwin L. Harper , 47 , the chief financial officer , will run Campbell as a team , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named .
2175	Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern 's departure and its implications .
2181	Campbell 's international businesses , particularly in the U.K. and Italy , appear to be at the heart of its problems .
2182	Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units .
2183	For example , Campbell is a distant third in the U.K. frozen foods market , where it recently paid 24 times earnings for Freshbake Foods PLC and wound up with far more capacity than it could use .
2184	Similarly , Campbell 's Italian biscuit operation , D. Lazzaroni & Co. , has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems .
2186	However , neither Mr. Baum nor Mr. Harper has much international experience .
2192	In recent months , Mr. Dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity .
2194	The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs .
2195	But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in Europe , and there were signs that the board became impatient .
2197	The company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` The CEO succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement . ''
2202	He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares .
2204	During Mr. McGovern 's nine-year term as president , the company 's sales rose to $ 5.7 billion from $ 2.8 billion and net income increased to $ 274 million from $ 130 million , the statement said .
2205	Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988 .
2208	Mr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company .
2211	Mr. Baum said the two have orders to `` focus on bottom-line profits '' and to `` take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good , what is not so good . ''
2212	Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell U.S.A. , the company 's largest division , which posted 6 % unit sales growth and a 15 % improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989 .
2214	In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon , both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together .
2218	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
2249	Robert L. Bernstein , chairman and president of Random House Inc. , announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years .
2252	In an interview , Mr. Bernstein said his departure `` evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that 's the decision I reached . ''
2255	Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon .
2256	Mr. Newhouse , meanwhile , insisted that he is n't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House , the largest trade publishing house in the U.S. .
2260	Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . ''
2261	Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily .
2266	Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division .
2268	There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family .
2269	Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit .
2271	Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .
2273	Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . ''
2275	It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution .
2276	This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .
2280	As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .
2281	It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution .
2284	Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation .
2285	It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress .
2287	During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .
2289	Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .
2291	Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . ''
2298	Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .
2299	Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations .
2300	Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny .
2301	There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
2302	Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''
2303	This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto .
2305	President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
2309	By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
2310	If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
2314	Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto .
2321	In that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive .
2327	If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''
2329	His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year .
2332	Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday .
2334	The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains .
2335	What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs .
2337	In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices .
2338	To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas .
2341	It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year .
2343	At the same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said Keith Collins , a department analyst .
2346	California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion .
2347	Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income .
2351	Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline .
2352	At the same time , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets .
2354	Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .
2358	But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register , which sells more than 300,000 copies a day , and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News , which sells more than 170,000 .
2359	Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies .
2361	Speculation had it that the company was asking $ 100 million for an operation said to be losing about $ 20 million a year , but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away .
2362	An attempted buy-out led by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as `` tire-kickers and lookee-loos '' had filed through since .
2363	The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun .
2365	Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies .
2367	Further , the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times .
2368	Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan .
2369	The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American , which folded , and the Boston Herald-American , which was sold , as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s .
2375	`` Actually , the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end , and the industry looks pretty healthy . ''
2376	Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst , the Herald was crippled by a bitter , decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half .
2379	He and his successor , Mary Anne Dolan , restored respect for the editorial product , and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources , its accomplishments were notable .
2381	The Herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded .
2382	Robert J. Danzig , vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers , stood up in the paper 's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold , putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work .
2383	Hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days .
2389	`` I 'm doing the main story , and I 'm already two beers drunk , '' said reporter Andy Furillo , whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference .
2395	The radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions .
2400	American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card .
2401	The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card .
2402	They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders .
2404	Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , '' says a spokeswoman for the division .
2410	Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses .
2411	Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . ''
2412	To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card .
2413	Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says .
2414	Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm .
2415	But GMAC approved the Buick program , he says , because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates .
2416	Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick `` very sophisticated direct-mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability . ''
2418	When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says .
2419	American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. , and over half have the green card .
2423	A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link .
2424	Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .
2425	The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals .
2426	Destinations are Chicago ; Honolulu ; Las Vegas , Nev. ; Los Angeles ; Miami Beach , Fla. ; New Orleans ; New York ; Orlando , Fla. ; San Francisco ; and Washington , D.C.
2427	A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines .
2428	In lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder .
2429	Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes .
2434	The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks .
2435	The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
2436	As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .
2439	Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3\/8 point lower .
2448	Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .
2450	Already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings .
2451	Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC , Midland Bank PLC , Security Pacific Corp. , Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank , Citicorp 's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International .
2455	The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
2456	In the aftermath of the stock market 's gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13 , Kidder , Peabody & Co. 's 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country 's second-largest program trader .
2459	Since October 's minicrash , Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading , the computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes .
2461	The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards .
2464	On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges .
2466	Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .
2467	So far , Wall Street 's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors .
2468	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange , a major futures marketplace , yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading .
2471	The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake .
2478	Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable .
2479	Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them .
2480	What 's more , the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it .
2482	Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of the Big Board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered .
2483	He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines , rather than people .
2486	The battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations , causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee .
2487	At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away .
2489	The Big Board -- the nation 's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives .
2490	Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs .
2495	Again and again , program-trading 's critics raise the `` casino '' theme .
2499	Critics like Mr. Murray `` are looking for witches , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , '' says J. Thomas Allen , president of Advanced Investment Management Inc. , a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage .
2502	Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets .
2504	When it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks -LRB- such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index -RRB- in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .
2505	Such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds .
2508	The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise .
2509	`` If you continue to do this , the investor becomes frightened -- any investor : the odd lotter , mutual funds and pension funds , '' says Larry Zicklin , managing partner at Neuberger & Berman .
2510	But many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations .
2513	The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders , but by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp .
2514	Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock they had .
2517	Many arbs are `` overleveraged , '' she says , and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''
2518	Like virtually everything on Wall Street , the program-trading battle is over money , and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years .
2519	Take the traditional money managers , or `` stock pickers , '' as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys .
2520	Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors .
2524	Today , about $ 200 billion , or 20 % of all pension-fund stock investments , is held by index funds .
2525	The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms .
2526	These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30 % to 40 % a year on their capital , by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks .
2529	The son of a specialist and once one himself , Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets .
2532	`` The buyers walk away , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks , he contends .
2534	They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then .
2535	`` Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death , '' says Raymond A. Mason , chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore .
2536	Stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling .
2540	`` Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs ?
2543	Among the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods : Morgan Stanley & Co. , Kidder Peabody , Merrill Lynch , Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc .
2544	But then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard , particularly against index arbitrage .
2545	The indexers ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die .
2547	`` Wall Street 's cash cow has been gored , but I do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem . ''
2549	For example , stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched .
2550	Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s .
2561	The Big Board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered , Big Board officials say .
2563	Program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ''
2566	Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative .
2569	Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say .
2572	But in 1986 , program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets .
2574	Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets .
2581	In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York .
2582	To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago .
2583	If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .
2584	-LRB- Few , if any , index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100 % exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less than a 100 % position should stocks rise . -RRB-
2585	By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1 % and 3 % to the annual return of the S&P 500 .
2588	As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated .
2589	The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market .
2590	The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares .
2592	All arguments against program trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 -RRB- reduced volatility , 2 -RRB- a long-term investment focus , and 3 -RRB- a level playing field for the small investor .
2595	An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs .
2597	Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago .
2600	The start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .
2602	Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade .
2603	In a competitive market , this investor has many ways to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives -LRB- both foreign and domestic -RRB- if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle .
2605	Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .
2606	Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less .
2607	The speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome .
2610	We must be very cautious about labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . ''
2612	The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .
2613	A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .
2615	Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change -LRB- 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example -RRB- .
2624	This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits , but because of the firms championing the cause .
2626	They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell , while their clients continue to hope for superior performance .
2627	Even with mutual funds , the little investor continues to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance , while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk .
2629	Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences .
2632	Cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay , and that institutional customers refuse to pay .
2633	Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients , here or overseas .
2636	Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably .
2638	If government or private watchdogs insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets -LRB- limits on price moves , two-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. -RRB- , the end loser will be the markets themselves .
2639	Instead , we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants .
2642	The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission .
2644	To offset the reduction , Congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
2646	But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
2652	Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .
2654	Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts .
2655	`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep. Neal Smith -LRB- D. , Iowa -RRB- said during House debate .
2657	The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
2660	Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
2664	But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report .
2670	Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion , the environment and insurance reform .
2677	This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby 's .
2679	Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector .
2681	Most in demand : classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray .
2684	Currently a $ 300 million-a-year business , 900 telephone service is expected to hit $ 500 million next year and near $ 2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand , says Joel Gross of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc .
2685	The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $ 25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter , horoscopes and romance lines .
2686	But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected .
2687	`` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts .
2689	Charities test the waters , but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising .

2712	Program trading is `` a racket , '' complains Edward Egnuss , a White Plains , N.Y. , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor , that 's for sure . ''
2715	But like Mr. Egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be .
2717	He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading .
2719	He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds .
2726	Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''
2727	A. Donald Anderson , a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .
2729	Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . ''
2732	`` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . ''
2733	Peter Anthony , who runs an employment agency in New York , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .
2735	And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading .
2740	Also in New York , Israel Silverman , an insurance-company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned .
2743	Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says .
2744	He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund .

2767	The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit .
2769	The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
2770	Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
2772	A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised .
2777	Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use .
2785	William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank .
2787	He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons .
2789	Separately , Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61 a share , a year earlier .
2791	Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 .
2792	In addition , operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves .
2794	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :

2810	Maryland Community Development Administration , Department of Housing and Community Development --
2811	$ 80.8 million of single-family program bonds , 1989 fourth and fifth series , tentatively priced by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group to yield from 6.25 % in 1992 for fourth series bonds to 7.74 % in 2029 for fifth series bonds .

2815	The 7.40 % term bonds due 2009 are priced to yield 7.45 % , and 7.40 % term bonds due 2017 are priced to yield 7.50 % .
2817	They mature in 2005 , 2009 and 2029 .

2849	Something like one-third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg .
2852	He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
2856	Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .
2857	Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .
2858	But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % .
2864	Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .
2865	Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .
2868	But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
2870	`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''
2873	Today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
2874	Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5 % to # 89.7 million -LRB- $ 141.9 million -RRB- , or 16 pence a share , from # 94.8 million -LRB- $ 149.9 million -RRB- , or 17.3 pence a share .
2875	The British paper , packaging and publishing concern , said profit from continuing lines fell 10 % to # 118 million from # 130.6 million .
2876	While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period , there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period .
2878	Pretax profit fell 3.7 % to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts ' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million , but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London .
2886	Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their daily operations .
2888	But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms .
2892	Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .
2893	What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
2895	Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .
2896	`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .
2898	Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
2900	In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .
2903	Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .
2917	The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market .
2919	Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .
2924	`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
2926	Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems .
2927	Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co .
2928	But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. .
2929	Under the so-called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
2930	The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
2931	It was later applied to other new-car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar .
2933	Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions .
2935	We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt .
2936	But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk , technology and innovation .
2938	From the 1940s until 1971 , some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB- to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness .
2939	The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels .
2941	The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used .
2942	Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable .
2943	Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .
2947	Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties .
2950	Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .
2951	The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs .
2955	`` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said .
2958	We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .
2960	We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way .
2961	DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts .
2965	We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases .
2966	They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by Congress .
2971	The Dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders -LRB- $ 113.2 million -RRB- , or 6.70 guilders a share , from 144 million guilders , or 4.10 guilders a share , a year ago .
2974	Last year , DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions .
2978	Allergan Inc. said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens , the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery .
2979	The len 's foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery , the eye care and skin care concern said .
2983	Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .
2984	However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .
2989	The company said its industrial unit continues to face margin pressures and lower demand .
2990	In fiscal 1989 , Elco earned $ 7.8 million , or $ 1.65 a share .
2992	Oshkosh Truck Corp. , Oshkosh , Wis. , estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 50 % to 75 % below the year-earlier $ 4.5 million , or 51 cents a share .
2994	In fiscal 1988 , the company earned $ 17.3 million , or $ 1.92 a share , on revenue of $ 352.9 million .
2995	Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division , a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations .
2998	Tokyo stocks edged up Wednesday in relatively active but unfocused trading .
3004	Investors switched trading focus quickly as they did Tuesday , reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector , traders said .
3008	Institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar .
3009	The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 16.05 points Tuesday , was down 1.46 points , or 0.05 % , at 2691.19 .
3010	The Second Section index , which added 6.84 points Tuesday , was up 5.92 points , or 0.16 % , to close at 3648.82 .
3012	Akio Yamamoto , managing director of Nomura Investment Trust Management , said that if the U.S. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5 % , institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying .
3013	Tokyu Group , Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone\/Firestone , which advanced Tuesday , declined on profit-taking .
3016	Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency , investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares , which traders called a `` defensive '' action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation .
3018	Showa Shell gained 20 to 1,570 and Mitsubishi Oil rose 50 to 1,500 .
3019	Sumitomo Metal Mining fell five yen to 692 and Nippon Mining added 15 to 960 .
3022	London share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London 's blue-chip stocks .
3029	There were concerns early in the day that Wall Street 's sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal .
3033	They cited Wall Street 's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market 's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution .
3034	Jaguar , a U.K. luxury auto maker being pursued by Ford Motor and General Motors , gained 10 pence -LRB- 16 cents -RRB- a share to close at 879 pence -LRB- $ 13.90 -RRB- .
3042	Analysts said the fall in pretax profit was due to the group 's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units , and that its remaining businesses are performing well .
3048	Stock prices closed higher in Stockholm , Amsterdam and Frankfurt and lower in Zurich .
3049	Paris , Brussels , and Milan were closed for a holiday .

3070	Named as defendants were Roland Matthews , president , and Peter Jonas , executive vice president and chief financial officer , as well as a former plant manager .
3071	The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August .
3072	`` The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court . ''
3075	`` The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers , '' said Fabian Linden , executive director of the Conference Board 's consumer research center .

3087	Only 26.8 % in October , compared with 28.5 % in September and 26.8 % in October 1988 , said income would increase .
3089	`` Unemployment continues at a relatively low level , providing a sense of job security , and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong . ''
3091	Buying plans were mixed in October , with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months .
3097	In October , 30.6 % said they will buy appliances in the coming six months , compared with 27.4 % in September and 26.5 % in October 1988 .
3098	Despite a deluge of economic news , the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp. 's huge debt offering .
3099	`` There were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them , '' said Kathleen Camilli , a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
3100	`` So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said .
3101	IBM , the giant computer maker , offered $ 750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47 % , or about 1\/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds .
3102	The size of IBM 's issue was increased from an originally planned $ 500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds .
3103	In the investment-grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said James Ednie , a Drexel industrial bond trader .
3105	Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors .
3107	`` Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .
3110	A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .
3111	In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed 's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14. , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks .
3112	Among other things , the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries .
3113	The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts , for example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston , Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded .
3122	The Treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three-year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10-year notes .
3126	The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
3129	The benchmark 30-year bond about 1\/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
3137	Moody 's said those returns compare with a 3.8 % total return for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds .
3138	Total return measures price changes and interest income .
3145	Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
3146	Ginnie Mae 's 9 % issue for November delivery finished at 98 5\/8 , up 2\/32 , and its 9 1\/2 % issue at 100 22\/32 , also up 2\/32 .
3152	An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay , but market participants speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of investor interest , were responsible .
3154	A $ 107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency , Calif. , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today , according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
3162	Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue , or that the last Bund , a 7 % issue due October 1999 , would be increased by two billion marks .
3168	The rating concern said the textile and clothing company 's interest expense exceeds operating profit `` by a wide margin '' and it noted United 's estimated after-tax loss of $ 24 million for the year ended June 30 .
3170	Net advanced to $ 94.2 million , or 89 cents a share , from $ 85 million , or 83 cents a share , including net realized investment gains of $ 31 million , up from $ 10 million a year ago .
3176	The year-ago results included a $ 415 million charge in the 1988 second quarter for underperforming real estate and mortgage loans .
3177	The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC 's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd .
3178	The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase 's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires .
3181	Michelin officials could n't immediately comment on the referral , but they noted the purchase from BTR has already been concluded .
3184	The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain .
3186	The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean-air legislation .
3187	As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation .
3191	That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth .
3197	While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels .
3201	Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc. , Charlotte , acquired 30 % of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25 % from E.W. Scripps Co. next year .
3204	Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .
3205	On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points .
3206	The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
3209	Also , the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day .
3212	Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , SuperDot handles about 80 % of all orders entered at the exchange .
3213	Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy -LRB- for those who have purchased a contract -RRB- or deliver -LRB- for those who sold one -RRB- a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date .
3215	Indexing -- Many investors , mainly institutions , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500 .
3217	Program trading -- A wide range of computer-assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks .
3219	The newest breed , also called `` rocket scientists '' because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics , devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading .
3220	Stock-index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock-index futures or options .
3221	Traders profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options .
3222	If stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for example , an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures .
3223	Stock-index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date .
3225	The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor 's 500-stock index -LRB- traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -RRB- ; the Major Market Index , a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average -LRB- traded on the chicago Board of Trade -RRB- ; and the S&P 100 options -LRB- traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 -RRB- .
3226	Stock-index options -- Options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy -LRB- a call -RRB- or sell -LRB- a put -RRB- a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known as the strike price .
3227	For stock indexes , the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index .
3228	For example , there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index .
3234	Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control .
3238	Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out .
3239	Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share .
3240	Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .
3242	The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent .
3247	Reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate .
3252	But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company 's employees , primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists ' union , which has opposed a takeover .
3258	Williams , Duluth , Ga. , is an insurance and financial-services holding company .
3260	Primerica , as expected , also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities .
3262	Intelogic Trace Inc. , San Antonio , Texas , said it bought 2.7 million shares , or about 18 % , of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share , or $ 9.9 million .
3263	The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern .
3268	He added , `` This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed , particularly , to take the company private . ''
3269	But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared .
3276	Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , and community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases .
3278	The aerospace , automotive supply , electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough .
3279	In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .
3280	Still , he added , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million .
3281	For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a share .
3282	That compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier .
3283	The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share .
3285	Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment .
3288	For the year , electronics emerged as Rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings , muscling out aerospace for the first time .
3291	Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .
3292	That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines .
3293	The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship , according to analysts .
3294	For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 .
3298	The Austin , Texas-based company , which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories , said its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor .
3300	A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor , with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $ 5,699 , down from $ 6,799 .
3301	Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors , which the Dell models use , generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen .
3302	World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar this crop year and next .
3303	Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might have to buy a large quantity of sugar .
3305	The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day .
3309	According to reports carried by various news services , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
3310	One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential-Bache Securities , New York , estimated that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline .
3312	Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world .
3313	A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated .
3317	`` Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .
3318	As a result , Ms. Ganes said , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
3320	Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said .
3324	`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
3325	`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''
3327	On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
3328	`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
3331	This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
3339	The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
3351	Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
3352	According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .
3353	However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
3356	The parent of Younkers , after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores , said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing .
3358	But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
3360	It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
3361	Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer .
3363	Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $ 13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction .
3364	Under terms of the new proposal , Equus , managed by Equus Capital Corp. , Houston , would pay $ 12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $ 1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama 's 2.1 million shares outstanding .
3365	Previously , it offered $ 13.65 a share in cash , or $ 29 million .
3366	The El Paso , Texas , maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12 % rate , but would n't be paid for the first two years .
3368	Neither Equus nor Tony Lama gave a reason for the changed offer and Tony Lama could n't be reached for comment .
3371	Mr. Reupke , 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran , had been the information-services company 's general manager for only six months .
3372	His appointment to that post , which has senior administrative , staff and policy responsibilities , followed a several-year tenure as Reuters 's editor in chief .
3373	No successor was named , and Mr. Reupke 's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives , the company said .
3375	`` There is no business reason for my departure , '' nor any disagreement over policy , he added .
3379	A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects `` no change in strategy or profits . ''

3580	Earnings at Xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly , but that was largely because capital gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments .
3581	Property\/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters , as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments .

3588	Domestic sales of construction machinery , such as power shovels and bulldozers rose to 142.84 billion yen from 126.15 billion yen .

3623	Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation , a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor .
3624	All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds .
3626	And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes .
3630	Mr. Spiegel 's fans say Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .
3633	The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .
3634	Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer .
3636	Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
3641	That 's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
3642	But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right .
3645	These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value .
3647	It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings .
3648	One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up , as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank .
3649	But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .
3650	Some think Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence .
3652	Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say .
3655	You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York .

3669	Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein .

3671	Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it .

3675	The company added that it has filed patent applications `` on a large number of different BMP proteins '' and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received .

3691	Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks -LRB- $ 434.4 million -RRB- and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .
3694	The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry .

3697	ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .
3698	If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .

3714	An Upjohn spokesman said he had `` heard nothing '' to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .

3724	Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
3725	Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .
3726	The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation .
3731	Instead of 50\/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
3733	The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .
3734	Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi -LRB- now serving a jail sentence -RRB- , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese .
3736	It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .
3737	When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
3740	If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .

3756	In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .
3757	They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
3758	They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
3759	How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
3761	Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983-85 .
3762	The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships .
3766	Once its ownership is finalized , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities .
3767	Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said .
3768	Under an accord signed yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa -LRB- $ 23.5 million -RRB- .
3769	Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , and take a minority stake in the new company .
3774	Its plans to be acquired dashed , Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital .

3780	Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk , Va. , but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week .

3788	Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company .
3789	The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said .
3792	Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion .
3793	The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added .

3820	Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .
3825	Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .

3868	USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .
3869	The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share .
3873	The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing .
3874	However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .
3875	Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .
3877	Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .
3878	The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd .
3880	Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said .
3881	Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % .
3885	He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .
3889	USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .
3890	Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares .
3891	The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 .
3892	USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .
3893	The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .
3894	Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .
3895	Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
3897	John F. Barrett , 40 , formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer , posts which had been vacant .
3898	Leon J. Level , vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern , and F. Warren McFarlan , a professor at Harvard University 's Graduate School of Business , were elected directors , increasing board membership to nine .
3899	David A. DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named president and chief operating officer in August .
3901	Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
3906	The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
3908	Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
3909	They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
3910	Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
3918	Howard Mosher , president and chief executive officer , said he anticipates growth for the luxury auto maker in Britain and Europe , and in Far Eastern markets .
3922	Bell , based in Los Angeles , makes and distributes electronic , computer and building products .
3923	Investors are appealing to the Securities and Exchange Commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders .
3924	A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool , individual investors and professional money managers contend .
3926	The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often .
3927	Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the 1987 stock market crash -- and the markets already so stacked against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether .
3930	Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction .
3932	The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes .
3933	Investors , money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , Mr. Lane said .
3937	What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time .
3940	The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. Lane said .
3944	But Robert Gabele , president of Invest\/Net , a North Miami , Fla. , company that packages and sells the insider-trading data , said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports .
3945	Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later .
3950	The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in `` socially responsible '' companies , and a bond fund .
3951	Both funds are expected to begin operation around March 1 , subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval .
3954	The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the SEC in December .
3955	The new `` social choice '' fund will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland .
3956	Also excluded will be investments in companies with `` significant '' business stemming from weapons manufacture , alcoholic beverages or tobacco .
3957	Sixty percent of the fund will be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments .
3958	The bond fund will invest in high-grade or medium-grade bonds , mortgages or asset-backed securities , including as much as 15 % in foreign securities .
3959	The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department .
3960	Under two new features , participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or , if their jobs are terminated , receive cash from the funds .
3961	The investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund , an annuity and a money-market fund .
3962	New Brunswick Scientific Co. , a maker of biotechnology instrumentation and equipment , said it adopted an anti-takeover plan giving shareholders the right to purchase shares at half price under certain conditions .
3965	Solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited .
3966	The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem : He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting , so he does n't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again .
3968	Years ago , he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi , which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen 's `` Quartet for the End of Time . ''
3969	Today , the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work -LRB- though a touch of the old Tashi still survives -RRB- and now goes on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exceptions .
3971	But you ca n't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman 's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight .
3972	He believes in what he plays , and he plays superbly .
3974	It felt more like a party , or a highly polished jam session with a few friends , than a classical concert .
3975	Clad in his trademark black velvet suit , the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album , `` Inner Voices , '' had just been released , that his family was in the front row , and that it was his mother 's birthday , so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record .
3976	He launched into Saint-Saens 's `` The Swan '' from `` Carnival of the Animals , '' a favorite encore piece for cellists , with lovely , glossy tone and no bite .
3978	And so it went through the first half : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would disturb or challenge a listener .
3979	Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , pianist\/bassoonist\/composer and an old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez .
3980	An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas , beginning with `` Golden Rain , '' a lilting , laid-back lead in to the uptempo `` Sky , '' which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers .
3982	Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him `` the great improviser of the 18th century , '' and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions , cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas .
3983	Keeping the mood light , the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms , devised by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to Hindemith 's dry theory-teaching techniques , and then , with Mr. Gomez , soared and improvised on the composer 's tight `` Bebop Etudes . ''
3985	Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever , Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell 's `` For Free '' -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist , to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas 's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing , `` Deep Peace . ''
3986	`` Deep Peace '' also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds , beaches , deserts , sunsets , etc .
3987	It was all too mellow to be believed , but they probably would have gotten away with it , had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins 's signature tune , `` Amazing Grace , '' and ask for audience participation .
3988	That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings .
3989	Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half ?
3991	Either way it was a pity , because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission : Steve Reich 's `` New York Counterpoint , '' one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing .
3994	He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson 's images , this time of geometric or repeating objects , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it .
3995	The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with pictures for the Douglas pieces .
3996	It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club , but like the first half , much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable .
3998	Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell , but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements , served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals ?
4001	It was not an unpleasant evening , certainly , thanks to the high level of performance , the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas , and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections .
4002	But it was neither deep nor lasting : light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms .
4006	This is the U.N. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education , science and culture .
4009	But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond .
4010	The U.S. , along with Britain and Singapore , left the agency when its anti-Western ideology , financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand .
4011	The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention , such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds .
4012	Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case , but even his replacement , the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor , has had little success at achieving reforms .
4014	The Orwellian `` New World Information Order '' would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government , which would have licensing and censorship powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas .
4015	UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into `` peoples ' rights . ''
4016	Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament '' and `` the impact of the activities of transnational corporations . ''
4018	Glasnost may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted , `` The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO . ''
4020	Mr. Mayor 's hope that references to `` press freedom '' would survive unamended seems doomed to failure ; the current phrasing is `` educating the public and media to avoid manipulation . ''
4022	Soviets remain in charge of education programs , a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture , and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division .
4023	Of the agency 's 2,750 staff members , 230 are in the field working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research .
4029	This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries .
4030	Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home .
4032	This can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice .
4033	We can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to rejoin UNESCO .
4040	On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains .
4041	That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant .
4044	The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants .
4046	A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice .
4047	The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other .
4049	In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds .
4051	Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles .
4052	The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant .
4056	Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed .
4057	The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible .
4060	`` This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops , '' he said , and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop .
4061	He said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops .
4063	In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co .
4065	But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects .
4066	However , Paul Johanson , Monsanto 's director of plant sciences , said the company 's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is `` gentle on the female organ . ''
4067	Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif. , is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen .
4069	Robert Erwin , president of Biosource , called Plant Genetic 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` complementary rather than competitive . ''
4072	That 's because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton .
4073	`` It 's one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the plant , '' he said .
4075	A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies .
4076	The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan 's once-cozy financial circles .
4086	Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan , bankers here say , but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too .
4088	He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund , and would n't bail it out .
4090	`` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests . ''
4091	No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries .
4093	Both sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have been at a flashpoint for months .
4096	Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad , captain the opposing sides .
4104	Raymond E. Ross , 53 years old , formerly group vice president , U.S. plastics machinery , at this machine tool , plastics machinery and robots concern , was named senior vice president , industrial systems , succeeding David A. Entrekin , who resigned Monday .

4137	But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it .
4146	`` It does n't replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says .
4147	Back in 1975 , late in the season , a then-21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance , five and two-thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox .
4148	He gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision .
4152	These days he hustles to house-painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics .

4248	Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government 's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree .
4249	The golden share restricts any individual holding to 15 % and expires at the end of 1990 .
4250	It was in Jaguar 's best interests `` for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , '' Mr. Ridley said .
4252	Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been trying to amass 15 % stakes in Jaguar .
4253	Ford , which already has an unwelcome 13.2 % holding , is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early .
4254	GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30 % .
4268	Such a countermove could end Jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and British-owned .
4272	`` It 's either going to be a shootout , or there only may be one player in town , '' one person said .
4274	In a statement , Jaguar 's board said they `` were not consulted about the -LRB- Ridley decision -RRB- in advance and were surprised at the action taken . ''
4278	Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management .
4279	Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting .
4280	But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
4283	`` Our intensive discussions with Jaguar , at their invitation , '' GM said , `` have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with Jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company , to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders . ''
4289	`` It 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with , '' observed Daniel Jones , professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales .
4290	The government , already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy , has been badly hurt by last week 's shake-up in Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet .

4299	William A. Wise , 44 years old , president of the El Paso Natural Gas Co. unit of this energy and natural-resources concern , was named to the additional post of chief executive officer , succeeding Travis H. Petty , 61 , who continues as a vice chairman of the parent .
4300	Erwin Tomash , the 67-year-old founder of this maker of data communications products and a former chairman and chief executive , resigned as a director .

4316	Sales of new cars in Europe fell 4.2 % in September from a year earlier and analysts say the market could continue to soften in the months ahead .
4318	Statistics from 12 countries which normally account for 94 % of non-communist Europe 's passenger car sales showed new car registrations totaled 911,606 in September , down 21 % from August and down 4.2 % for the year to date .
4326	But other sectors failed to attract investor interest and remained sluggish , making overall trading appear mixed .
4327	Individuals and corporations , as well as dealers trading for their own account , actively bought Tuesday .
4329	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section , which declined 5.16 on Monday , was up 16.05 , or 0.60 % , at 2692.65 on Tuesday .
4330	The Second Section index , which fell 21.44 points Monday , was up 6.84 points , or 0.19 % , to close at 3642.90 .
4346	In London , prices finished at intraday peaks , comforted by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street and news that the British government will waive its `` golden share '' in auto maker Jaguar .
4347	But trading was very sketchy , as investment decision makers remain wary from gyrations and upsets of recent weeks .
4349	`` The market was dragged up by the scruff of its neck by Wall Street and by market makers getting caught short .
4355	Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar , the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor .
4356	The golden share dates from Jaguar 's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover .
4360	As the London trading session drew to a close , the market was still listening to the parliamentary debate on the economy , with new Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major expected to clarify his approach to the British economy and currency issues .
4366	Elsewhere , share prices closed higher in Amsterdam , Brussels , Milan and Paris .
4367	Prices were mixed in Zurich and lower in Stockholm .
4368	Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong , Manila , Singapore , Sydney and Wellington , but were lower in Seoul .
4373	French consumer prices rose 0.2 % in September from the previous month and were up 3.4 % from a year earlier , according to definitive figures from the National Statistics Institute .
4374	The state agency 's figures confirm previous estimates and leave the index at 178.9 , up from 178.5 in August and 173.1 a year earlier .
4377	An official linked the gain essentially to higher prices for beef and pork .
4380	The leading index recovered from July 's revised level of 36.6 on strong performances in consumer durables and machinery orders , among other factors , according to an agency spokeswoman .
4385	Metromedia , headed by John W. Kluge , has interests in telecommunications , robotic painting , computer software , restaurants and entertainment .
4386	South Korean consumer prices rose 5 % in the first 10 months of this year , matching the government 's target for the entire year , according to the Bank of Korea and the Economic Planning Board .
4387	According to reports released by the two government agencies , domestic consumer and wholesale prices each rose by 0.2 % in October from the previous month .
4388	As a result , consumer prices for the first 10 months of 1989 surged by 5 % and wholesale prices by 1.3 % .
4390	Martin Marietta Corp. said it won a $ 38.2 million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to manufacture and install automated mail-sorting machines .
4391	Under terms of the three-year contract , Martin Marietta said it will make and install 267 of the new machines at 156 postal offices .
4392	The new machines are capable of sorting by zip code up to 10,000 large flat mail pieces , including magazines and parcels , an hour .
4393	Thomas A. Donovan , 37 years old , formerly vice president , West Coast operations , at this hazardous-waste-site remediation concern , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer , both newly created posts , and a director , filling a vacancy .
4394	Canonie said it anticipates naming Mr. Donovan to succeed Richard F. Brissette , 55 , as president and chief executive officer , effective March 1 .
4395	Mr. Brissette will remain a Canonie board member and will be a consultant to the company .

4421	I was a last-minute -LRB- read interloping -RRB- attendee at a French journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken up entirely by eating , drinking , smoking , sleeping and drinking .
4424	The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing -LRB- ballooning to you ; the brothers Montgolfier , French of course , were the world 's first hot-air balloonists -RRB- .
4428	Americans it seems have followed Malcolm Forbes 's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way .
4430	Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S. , including the world 's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs -- the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons , some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda , Garfield or a 12-story-high condom .
4435	The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess , or even a measure of derring-do .
4445	To wit , my maiden voyage -LRB- and novitiates are referred to as virgins -RRB- began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field .
4446	-LRB- Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk , when the winds are lightest . -RRB-
4447	In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order -LRB- the baskets hold no more than four passengers -RRB- .
4449	After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields .
4451	Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us .
4456	You can go only up or down -LRB- by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot -RRB- and ride the air currents .
4458	Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour .
4461	`` What 's he doing ? '' hissed my companion , who was the only other English-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white .
4464	Our pilot simply laughed , fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us , oh , a good 12-inches above the water level .
4469	Back in the chase car , we drove around some more , got stuck in a ditch , enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch .
4470	We finally rendezvoused with our balloon , which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground , punching all the air out of it , rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer .
4471	It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole .
4472	This meant returning to the golf course , where we watched a few French duffers maul the first tee while we sat under Cinzano umbrellas , me nursing an espresso and my ego .
4473	A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes .
4475	As for the ride back to camp , our pilot and all the other French-speaking passengers clambered into the chase car .
4476	My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket .
4477	As we streaked by a blase gendarme , I could n't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting .
4480	Testifying before a House subcommittee , Mr. Mulford said that if the Treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have `` unhinged financial markets . ''
4481	Mr. Mulford , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . ''
4482	Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing .
4485	Rep. John LaFalce -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said Mr. Johnson refused to testify jointly with Mr. Mulford and instead asked to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony .
4487	Mr. Mulford said reports of tension between the Treasury and Fed have been exaggerated , insisting that they involved `` nuances . ''
4491	But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than expected , Mr. Mulford said , it 's difficult for the U.S. to argue that Germany ought to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies .
4494	Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors : E. Garrett Bewkes III , a 38-year-old managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department ; Michael R. Dabney , 44 , a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions ; Richard Harriton , 53 , a general partner who heads the correspondent clearing services ; Michael Minikes , 46 , a general partner who is treasurer ; and William J. Montgoris , 42 , a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer .
4498	Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons , as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon .
4503	Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted .
4511	France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks .
4516	The dispute over that issue , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty stopper , '' and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it .
4518	Greece and Turkey , for example , are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other .
4520	`` It 's just going to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs -LCB- the Warsaw Pact 's -RCB- , '' says one NATO analyst .
4521	So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed .
4528	Two of the 757-200s are new aircraft to be delivered to American Trans Air , the main subsidiary of Amtran Inc. , in December 1991 and January 1992 .
4530	Delivery of the first aircraft is set for early November , a second for December and two for April 1990 .
4531	Norway 's unemployment rate for October was 3.6 % , unchanged from September but up from 2.6 % in the same month last year .
4533	Including those in the state programs , there were 143,800 Norwegians , or about 6.5 % of the work force , without permanent employment in October , up from September 's 136,800 .
4539	So far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into bottling operations in Australia , New Zealand and France .
4542	That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine .
4543	In countries such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks .
4544	And unlike Europe and the U.S. , where populations are aging , the Pacific Basin countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of Coca-Cola and other sodas .
4545	A Coca-Cola spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured , or how much the company would invest in the transaction .
4547	By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing .
4552	Fraser & Neave , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and Brunei , where per-capita consumption is n't as high as in Singapore .
4557	The increase follows the company 's report of strong earnings for the third quarter , and reflects what American Brands called its `` tradition of sharing earnings growth '' with shareholders .
4558	American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco , distilled spirits and life insurance .
4560	Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder .
4564	His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies .
4569	The value of the two transactions was n't disclosed , but an IFI spokesman said no cash would change hands .
4570	The move strengthens the existing links between the Agnellis and the Aga Khan , the head of the world 's Ismaili Moslems who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes sailing with Mr. Agnelli .
4571	Mr. Agnelli and the Aga Khan also have some business ties , and a spokesman for the Agnelli company did n't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration .
4572	For instance , Ifint earlier this year bought an 18 % stake in Alisarda , the Aga Khan 's airline , which flies between Italy and Sardinia .
4577	It unfortunately encourages others to engage in a highly dangerous and illegal activity that only a very few are doing now .
4578	And it treats such activities in a frivolous , cavalier fashion , with total indifference to common sense and public safety .
4583	MCI Communications Corp. said it received a three-year contract valued at more than $ 15 million to provide network , credit-card and other telecommunications services to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
4584	Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed on a compromise minimum-wage bill , opening the way for the first wage-floor boost in more than nine years .
4585	The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue .
4586	President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue .
4588	Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders , the minimum wage would rise from the current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 .
4589	Employers could also pay a subminimum `` training wage '' for 90 days to new workers who are up to 19 years old , and then for another 90 days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers .
4591	`` For the first time in history , we have a training wage that will be part '' of the nation 's labor laws , said Roger Porter , assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy .
4600	In the Senate , Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of the Labor Committee , and Pete Domenici , -LRB- R. , N.M . -RRB- ranking minority member of the Budget Committee , have been working on a compromise , and their soundings showed that the Senate appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another Bush veto , a Democratic staff official said .
4605	Mr. Kennedy suggested Democrats `` yielded a great deal '' on the size of the increase , but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage , which he said make it `` less harsh . ''
4607	The AFL-CIO , which previously opposed the administration 's subminimum idea , said the compromise has `` adequate safeguards , so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced . ''
4609	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $ 3.2 billion of Houston Lighting & Power Co. 's securities because of the company 's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation .
4611	Downgraded by Moody 's were Houston Lighting 's first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution-control bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2 ; unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-3 ; preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A-2 ; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2 ; two shelf registrations for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2 , and the unit 's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1 .
4612	Moody 's said Houston Lighting 's current situation has some positive aspects , including managing `` very well '' the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant .
4613	Capital requirements will be declining and no new generating facilities will be required for several years , Moody 's said .
4614	Scott C. Smith , formerly vice president , finance , and chief financial officer of this media concern , was named senior vice president .
4619	The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses , which include ceramic tile , floor coverings and furniture .
4620	Moreover , such a sale could help Armstrong reassure its investors and deter the Belzbergs , who own a 9.85 % stake in the Lancaster , Pa. , company .
4621	Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition .
4622	The carpet division had 1988 sales of $ 368.3 million , or almost 14 % of Armstrong 's $ 2.68 billion total revenue .
4625	For the past year or two , the carpet division 's operating profit margins have hovered around 5 % , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared with the 13 % to 19 % margins for two of Armstrong 's chief businesses , flooring and building products .
4626	Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and Shaw , the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry , with an estimated 17 % to 20 % share .
4627	Shaw , based in Dalton , Ga. , has annual sales of about $ 1.18 billion , and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands , sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names .
4630	Yesterday , Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months , worsened by the stock dilution of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year .
4631	For the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents a share , including a one-time gain of $ 5.9 million .
4632	In the year-ago quarter , earnings were $ 42.9 million , or 93 cents a share .
4635	Armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late November and the carpet sale in December , with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or first-quarter results .
4636	The government 's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2 % in September , but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing .
4637	The small increase in the index of leading indicators , which had climbed 0.5 % in August but was unchanged in July , does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably .
4640	So far this year , the index of leading indicators has risen in four months , fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month .
4642	The declines were particularly pronounced in the Northeast and in the South , where Hurricane Hugo was a factor .
4644	The September drop was the largest since a 19 % drop in January 1982 , but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators .
4645	Because the figures are based on a small sample , the department said it is 90 % confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between 5 % and 23 % during the month .
4651	Of the 11 components to the index , only three others rose in September : the money supply , the length of the average work week and stock prices .
4653	These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new plant and equipment , and backlogs of orders for durable goods .
4654	Meanwhile , the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61 % do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later .
4657	The other 40 % said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down .
4660	After various adjustments , they produced a 0.5 % rise in the index for August and a 0.2 % rise for September .
4661	September , and the change from August , are : from 1.11 in the previous month .
4664	As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant 's performance .
4667	The average interest rate rose to 8.3875 % at Citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , from 8.337 % at last week 's sale .
4674	An imaginative novelist writing a thriller about amateur spy-chasing might invent a Clifford Stoll , but it 's unlikely .
4676	Amateur spy-chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person , or as he might waggishly put it , a surreal person .
4677	He is 37 , an astronomer with impressive credentials , and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding .
4678	He once described himself as a `` Berkeley Hippie , '' and played the role well ; obligatory ragged jeans , a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional , including , for a time at least , formal marriage to his `` sweetheart , '' Martha Matthews .
4679	He also is an entertaining writer , combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work .
4681	The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans , accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB .
4683	He probably did n't penetrate any top-secret files , but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates , Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski , $ 15,000 for some of the material Hess collected .
4688	Once his cuckoo 's egg was laid , he could enter Unix and become a `` super-user , '' with access to everything .
4689	Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab 's computers .
4690	He discovered a 75-cent discrepancy in the charges made to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named `` Hunter , '' who had no valid billing address .
4692	But after much tracking , it became evident to Mr. Stoll , through various clues , that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California .
4698	The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies .
4699	The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets .
4700	When the hacker moved , Mr. Stoll moved too , calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion .
4701	Sometimes , if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file , he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his quarry .
4702	The FBI initially showed little interest , and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape .
4704	One learns a lot from this book , or seems to , about crippling federal bureaucracy .
4705	`` Seems to '' because it 's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll .
4709	The West Germans then took over and finally found Markus Hess .
4710	Eventually , Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and NSA to brief high-ranking officers on computer theft .
4714	He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal `` spooks '' who make national security their business .
4717	Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp .
4720	The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors .
4725	Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering ; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications .
4727	The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines .
4732	Last month , for example , Mips agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France 's Groupe Bull .
4733	Sony Corp. , Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan 's NEC Corp. and West Germany 's Siemens A.G. have agreed to make Mips chips under license .
4734	Today 's agreement gives Control Data a machine to compete against Digital and other general-purpose computer makers , said John Logan , a computer-market analyst at Aberdeen Group Inc. of Boston .
4738	Nixdorf , Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine , said Mips President Robert Miller .
4743	Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit .
4744	In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
4746	Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress .
4751	But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , Ways and Means members argued .
4753	The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years .
4754	The new S&L bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets , but that is a net cost .
4757	David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions .
4758	He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit .
4760	`` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow -LCB- S&L sales -RCB- or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
4762	The natural gas pipeline concern said the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two Panhandle Eastern units - Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Trunkline Gas Co .
4763	Texas Eastern Transmission will build and operate the system , which will connect the Arkoma Basin with several interstate pipelines .
4764	Now was that a quarter cup or a half cup ?
4765	Not a gripping question , unless you 're the pastry chef of this city 's Chez Panisse restaurant and you 've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook .
4768	The Berkeley police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for sweets .
4769	Instead , they figure the culprit probably took money from Ms. Shere 's wallet and discarded all the tips in the five-by-eight-inch looseleaf .
4770	Chez Panisse , whose founder , Alice Waters , is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as California cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance , has n't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft .
4771	For one thing , Ms. Shere can draw on her cookbook , published by Random House four years ago , which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet , gooseberry fool -LRB- a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries -RRB- and hazelnut `` oeufs a la neige . ''
4776	Many in the Bay Area 's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. Shere kept only one copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from Baker 's Dozen , a group of California pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture .
4777	Ms. Shere has offered a $ 500 reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch .
4779	`` There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk .
4784	The company has declined requests to discuss the changes , but Mr. Weekes has said that Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team .
4785	Scott Wakeman was named president and chief operating officer of U.S. operations , titles that had been held by Mr. Weekes .
4786	Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc. , another company controlled by Mr. Hollander .
4788	James R. Lees , 51 , vice president of Newport 's European operations , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations , assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes .
4793	The split and quarterly dividend will be payable Jan. 3 to stock of record Nov. 16 , the company said .
4795	Separately , UniFirst reported that net income rose 21 % to $ 3 million , or 29 cents a share adjusted for the split , for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 26 .
4796	A year earlier UniFirst earned $ 2.4 million , or 24 cents a share adjusted for the split .
4799	The lumber , insulation and fireproofing concern said the transaction , which includes a swap of other timber interests , would result in a $ 13.5 million after-tax gain , to be recorded in the fourth quarter .
4800	Healthcare International Inc. said it reached a 120-day standstill agreement with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $ 5 million right away and additional amounts in the future .
4801	Under the agreement , Healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said it would pay HealthVest $ 3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ 1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities .
4802	In return , HealthVest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120-day period .
4803	After the payment , Healthcare still will be $ 6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare .
4805	In addition , Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ 2.7 million to $ 3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period , to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales .
4806	Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $ 4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note .
4807	The funds should help ease a cash bind at HealthVest , which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July .
4808	A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank .
4809	Healthcare , which has been in a severe liquidity bind , said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. in which Greenery purchased stock and warrants for $ 500,000 and loaned Healthcare $ 9 million .
4810	The loan is backed by Healthcare 's 5.4 % stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities .
4813	But the Reserve Fund , America 's first money fund , was not named , nor were the creators of the money-fund concept , Harry Brown and myself .
4814	We innovated telephone redemptions , daily dividends , total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ 1 pershare pricing , all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC .
4817	The crowning moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant , marble-columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as President Judge of Cambria County .
4818	Baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench .
4822	But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and , some say , an arrogant and abusive one .
4824	Last March , nine months after the judge 's swearing-in , the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of `` official oppression '' in Cambria County , a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania .
4825	The allegations , ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness , paint a disquieting picture .
4826	According to testimony in a public , 80-page grand-jury report handed up to the state attorney general , Judge O'Kicki extorted cash from lawyers , muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for more than a decade .
4827	Prosecutors , in an indictment based on the grand jury 's report , maintain that at various times since 1975 , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship ; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set up a dummy corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend -LRB- now his second wife -RRB- ; and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in Cambria County .
4828	In testimony recorded in the grand jury report , court employees said the judge , now 59 years old , harassed his secretaries , made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone who crossed him .
4829	Bailiffs claimed they were required to chauffeur him to and from work , mow his lawn , chop his wood , fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown mutts , Dixie and Husky .
4834	The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this week , vehemently denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery . ''
4835	He blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them .
4840	Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year .
4841	Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says Maurice Geiger , founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier , Vt. , a public interest group that researches rural justice issues .
4842	As a result , says Mr. Geiger , lawyers think twice before appealing a judge 's ruling , are reluctant to mount , or even support , challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a judge 's integrity .
4843	Judge O'Kicki , a stern and forbidding-looking man , has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades .
4844	The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent , he was raised in a small borough outside Ebensburg , the Cambria County seat , and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School .
4845	He graduated near the top of his class , serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh , who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and , now , U.S. Attorney General .
4846	It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters .
4847	He divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk .
4848	Last year , Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr. O'Kicki one of the finest judges `` not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States . ''
4852	He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania .
4858	`` What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society , the banks and the bar association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat , a newspaper in nearby Johnstown , shortly after the scandal became public .
4859	`` If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago , the judicial process would n't be under the taint it is today . ''
4860	Officials with the Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board , the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct , counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in Ebensburg .
4868	Mr. Green thought little of it , he told the grand jury , until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback .
4869	`` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or part of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. Green said the judge asked him .
4871	But he did n't complain to the state 's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board , either , saying later that he feared retribution .
4873	Like most of Cambria County 's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge , Mr. Green declined to be interviewed for this article .
4875	`` I do n't have anything much to say , and I think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here , '' says local attorney Edward F. Peduzzi .
4878	The judge was considered imperious , abrasive and ambitious , those who practiced before him say .
4879	He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high-backed leather chair at his bench , while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom .
4881	Visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the years , months , weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge , giving Judge O'Kicki the seniority required to take over as the county 's top court administrator .
4882	The judge , they say , was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments .
4887	`` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . ''
4900	`` I find myself in an adversary relationship with Laurel Bank , and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report .
4902	The judge now says it was `` unfortunate '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to extort there . ''
4904	It refinanced the judge 's loan , lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade-in that had n't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up 1981 Chevy Citation the dealer had to repair before it could be resold .
4910	His seven-bedroom cedar and brick house outside of Johnstown is up for sale to pay for his lawyers .
4915	`` If I lose , I lose my position , my career , my pension , my home and my investments , '' says the judge .
4916	`` My God and I know I am correct and innocent .
4919	I await his sequel : the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in .
4922	As a money manager and a grass-roots environmentalist , I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint each year , but that only 1.4 % of it comes from recycled paper .
4924	With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills , and with our country overflowing with trash , all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources .
4926	Please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels , and increase your use of recycled paper .

4947	The Series 1989 A bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P .
4949	The Series 1989 B bonds are uninsured and rated double-A by Moody 's and S&P .
4950	Both the Series 1989 A and Series 1989 B bonds were priced to yield from 6 % in 1991 to 7.15 % in 2008-2009 , according to a Merrill Lynch official .
4954	The bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P .

4986	The Wellesley , Mass. , maker of scientific instruments and electronic parts said Berthold expects 1989 sales of more than 100 million Deutsche marks -LRB- $ 54.5 million -RRB- and employs about 400 people .
4987	Berthold is based in Wildbad , West Germany , and also has operations in Belgium .
4988	John M. Kucharski , EG&G 's chairman and chief executive , said the acquisition `` will extend EG&G 's core technologies , strengthen its position in the European Economic Community and assure a strength and presence in the Eastern European market . ''
4989	He said it especially will strengthen the company 's efforts in the rapidly growing field of bio-analytical instrumentation , and in applied nuclear physics .
4991	The sale , for $ 7 million in cash and securities , will leave EG&G with a 12 % stake in Transgenic , executives said .
4992	Mason is the largest toxicology lab in New England , with annual revenue of $ 8 million and 140 employees .
4993	Mason serves commercial and government customers , including the National Institutes of Health .
4994	The combined companies will become profitable by January 1990 , said James P. Sherblom , Transgenic 's chairman and chief executive officer .
4999	Separately , a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt 's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $ 65.7 million settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A. , another major creditor in the case .
5003	Regarding Mr. Hunt 's taxes , he and the IRS have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the IRS would get 70 % of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and 30 % would go to other creditors .
5005	The IRS had demanded $ 90 million but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $ 60 million .
5006	Grover Hartt III , a government lawyer , warned that Mr. Hunt stood to lose certain oil and gas properties , $ 200,000 in English pottery , a Colorado condominium and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the IRS .
5007	`` But they wanted to roll the dice and we 're going to let them , '' Mr. Hartt said .
5011	An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known as mortgage-backed securities .
5012	As much as 10 % of new U.S. mortgage securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association , or Fannie Mae , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , or Freddie Mac , now flow into Japanese hands .
5015	`` You ca n't say it 's a `` tsunami '' -LRB- tidal wave -RRB- , but we 're making some headway , '' says Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , who visits Tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities .
5023	`` This year , some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot . ''
5029	While they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government , as Treasury bonds are , it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary .
5032	The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ 900 billion , or nearly half of the $ 2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued .
5036	Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time , issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity .
5038	`` Two or three years ago , the problem was that people did n't understand the prepayment risk , '' says Nomura 's Mr. Kato .
5039	`` So they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment . ''
5041	But Japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments , so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems .
5046	In addition , further packaging of mortgage-backed securities , such as Blackstone 's fund , have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to .
5047	Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments .
5049	Therefore , the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of academia .
5050	Although poison pills come in different colors and shapes , they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically , if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation 's stock .
5054	Critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to shareholders .
5058	Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period ?
5065	The limit could range from three years to seven years , depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan .
5066	At the end of this period , the poison pill would be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders , who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management team at that time .
5072	The attitude of the Wisconsin Investment Board reflects a growing receptivity to time-limited poison pills on the part of institutional investors , as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the Council of Institutional Investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions .
5074	Such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills .
5075	Mr. Pozen is the general counsel and a managing director of Fidelity Investments in Boston .
5076	Michael Blair , former president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp. , failed to win election to the company 's board at a special shareholder meeting .
5077	Mr. Blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the Ontario Supreme Court for unjust dismissal against Enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder , Canadian Express Ltd. , and two executives of Hees International Bancorp Inc. , which controls Canadian Express .
5079	Mr. Blair and Hees have been feuding for months .
5083	Mr. Blair said his libel suit seeks 10 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 8.5 million -RRB- from Canadian Express and Hees executives Manfred Walt and Willard L'Heureux .
5085	Hees and Canadian Express executives could n't be reached for comment .
5088	Hees is a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman .
5093	Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities , nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public .
5094	`` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says Raymond Pettit , senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group .
5096	But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being .
5100	During the past year , government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged Japanese companies to refrain from flashy real estate purchases in the
5101	Since the mid-1980s , Japan 's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp. 's $ 670 million purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc. 's $ 610 million purchase of the Exxon Building , part of Rockefeller Center , in 1986 .
5102	In Los Angeles , Arco Plaza was sold to Shuwa Corp. for $ 620 million in 1986 , and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $ 300 million for Atlanta 's IBM Tower last year .
5104	Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties .
5106	`` Those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to refrain , but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention , '' says an official of the Japan-U.S . Business Council .
5108	First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share .
5109	Secondly , the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications .
5111	`` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi .
5112	Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
5114	The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the Marunouchi district , the business and financial center of Tokyo , often jokingly called `` Mitsubishi Village . ''
5115	The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants ' district .
5116	At the time , Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center .
5118	That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally government-business , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties .
5121	Its earnings can rise 10 % to 12 % annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases , says Graeme McDonald , an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd .
5128	Mitsubishi Estate has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase , which are due in cash next April , but the Marunouchi holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen .
5130	Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants .
5135	Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop Marunouchi into a business center of high-tech buildings , a project budgeted for 30 years and six trillion yen .
5136	Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today 's public enemies , but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters .
5137	The Warner Bros. studio and Sony signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday , asking a Los Angeles Superior Court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on Warner 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from taking the top posts at Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
5139	Sony is acquiring Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $ 5 billion .
5140	Warner Communications Inc. , which is being acquired by Time Warner , has filed a $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers .
5141	Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio .
5142	The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business .
5143	But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week .
5144	Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions .
5147	Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company , but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS .
5149	In addition , Sony is expected to agree to swap Columbia 's 35 % stake in the sprawling Burbank , Calif. , studio that Warner and Columbia share , in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired with the purchase of Lorimar Telepictures Corp .
5151	One , for example , came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff , who will head a committee that will oversee Sony 's entertainment division , including both records and movies .
5152	In his affidavit , Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an `` antiSony , anti-Japanese bias '' and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason .
5153	Mr. Ross , who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after the merger is complete , denied that in his own affidavit , and called Mr. Yetnikoff 's remarks `` vicious '' and his claims `` reckless , irresponsible and baseless , '' saying Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan .
5154	Mr. Ross also said he enjoys `` warm professional and personal relationships '' with Japanese executives including Sony Chairman Akio Morita , `` who has visited my home here . ''
5155	But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff , officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities .
5156	Time executives such as the company 's president , N.J . Nicholas , who will eventually be co-chief executive of Time Warner alongside Mr. Ross , have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo , and were never directly drawn into the fray .
5157	Talks between the two sides could unravel , of course , as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
5160	Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner .
5161	The Guber-Peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at Warner , including `` Bonfire of the Vanities '' and `` A Bright Shining Lie . ''
5162	But that does n't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects ; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year .
5164	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future sequels to `` Batman , '' the blockbuster hit they produced for Warner .
5165	But in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment , Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from `` Batman , '' since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce .
5167	Southern Co. 's Gulf Power Co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion , and paid $ 500,000 in fines .
5169	The company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes .
5170	`` The terms announced today are strictly between the United States and Gulf Power , '' said U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr .
5172	The plea settlement does not allow Southern Co. to charge any of the $ 500,000 to its customers , or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry .
5174	In a statement , Southern Co. President Edward L. Addison said , `` We believe our decision to plead -LRB- guilty -RRB- to these charges is responsible and proper .
5180	The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president Jacob F. `` Jake '' Horton was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- Appleyard , Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and Hemmer & Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988 .
5182	Government officials declined to say whether the investigation includes the ad agencies or the politicians involved .
5200	Seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period , says Richard Shaw , vice president of U.S. direct marketing .
5204	MOST FOOD companies these days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products to appeal to health-conscious consumers .
5210	Borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced-fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets , he says .
5211	Borden even tested a milk with 4 % butterfat in the South , but decided the market was too small .
5212	Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and parts of New Jersey .
5217	Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired .
5224	To increase their share of that business , jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc. 's Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc. , maker of Anne Klein jewelry , are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies .
5225	They 're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels , and they 're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase .
5234	Jewelry makers rarely pay commissions and are n't expected to anytime soon .

5242	Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash , but claims against the jetliner 's maker are being pursued , a federal judge said .
5243	Northwest , a unit of NWA Inc. , and McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which made the MD-80 aircraft , also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport .
5248	The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas , Northwest 's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash , and McDonnell Douglas ' claim that the plane was improperly flown .
5249	The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that pilots failed to set the plane 's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would have detected the error .
5250	Also , a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the flaps and slats were not set for takeoff , the NTSB said .
5251	The only passenger who survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan , then 4 , of Tempe , Ariz. , whose parents and brother died in the crash .
5253	Sun Myung Moon , the Korean evangelist-industrialist who in 1954 founded the Unification Church , remains the mystery man behind a multimillion-dollar political and publishing operation based in this country and catering to the American right .
5255	Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal , political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy .
5256	His original strategy -LRB- in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion -RRB- was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions .
5257	Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds .
5258	More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America , as they had in Japan and South Korea .
5261	Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s spokesmen for both the Unification Church and its opponents in the anticult movement gave wildly exaggerated membership figures .
5263	It is still common to read in the press that the church has 10,000 or more full-time American members and 25,000 `` associates . ''
5266	Mr. Moon 's support for a Watergate-beleaguered Richard Nixon , the Koreagate scandal , and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church 's recruitment efforts .
5267	Defections , burnouts , and abduction `` deprogrammings '' kept member turnover high .
5271	For a while in the 1970s it seemed Mr. Moon was on a spending spree , with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center ; a fishing\/processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska , Massachusetts , Virginia and Louisiana ; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion -LRB- both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River -RRB- ; shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay ; a motion picture production company , and newspapers , such as the Washington Times , the New York City Tribune -LRB- originally the News World -RRB- , and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo .
5273	Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan , minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages .
5274	Those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers , peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $ 20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s , but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. Moon 's lavish international conferences , speaking tours , and assorted land buys .
5275	Only his factories in Japan and Korea , employing his followers at subsistence wages and producing everything from rifles to ginseng to expensive marble vases , kept the money flowing westward .
5277	Likewise , journalists John Burgess and Michael Isikoff of the Washington Post have estimated that at least $ 800 million was transferred from Japan to the U.S. to deal with the church 's annual operating losses in this country .
5279	Start-up costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $ 50 million , and the total amount lost in this journalistic black hole was estimated at $ 150 million by 1984 .
5280	Since then , Moon 's organization has inaugurated a pair of high-quality glossy opinion magazines , The World and I and Insight , which are a further drain .
5283	Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year .
5284	The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests -- and press scrutiny -- in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the thousand-person get-togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of years past .
5286	-LRB- Mr. Moon 's Paragon House eventually even published three of my co-edited books on religion and politics . -RRB-
5288	`` Everything , '' one non-`` Moonie '' senior consultant to the Unification Church recently told me in an interview , `` is going back to Korea and Japan . ''
5290	European politicians were less reluctant to have their governments investigate and harass new religions . -RRB-
5292	South Korea and Japan continue to be profitable .
5293	Moon 's Tong'Il industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in China , where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in Tiananmen Square .
5296	Mr. Moon has agreed to put up $ 10 million a year for 25 years and keep the profits in China .
5297	In return , he has the government 's blessing to build churches and spread Unificationism in that country .
5298	Whatever respectability and ties to intellectuals and opinion-makers the publications and conferences bring really are salvage -- not the Rev. Moon 's original final goals , but the ones for which he will have to settle .
5299	Mr. Shupe is co-author -LRB- with David G. Bromley -RRB- of `` ` Moonies ' in America : Cult , Church , and Crusade '' and `` Strange Gods : The Great American Cult Scare .
5301	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $ 765 million will be depleted next year , and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations .
5302	The trust , which was created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , ultimately expects to receive $ 2.5 billion from Manville , but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims .
5303	Spokespersons for both the trust and the company refused to comment on whether any talks with a possible acquirer of Manville had actually taken place .
5304	The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings , but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust .
5305	Manville , a forest and building products concern , has offered to pay the trust $ 500 million for a majority of Manville 's convertible preferred stock .
5306	Manville and the trust are discussing the offer , but no decision has been made .
5307	The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market ; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock ; or a recapitalization of Manville .
5310	Unemployment has reached 27.6 % in Azerbaijan , 25.7 % in Tadzhikistan , 22.8 % in Uzbekistan , 18.8 % in Turkmenia , 18 % in Armenia and 16.3 % in Kirgizia , the Communist Party newspaper said .
5311	All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union , and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months .
5312	The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West .
5313	Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said an `` Association of the Unemployed '' has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets , or 17 % of the work force .
5314	An 11-week dispute involving Australia 's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent 's tourist industry .
5321	The two , Szeto Wah and Martin Lee , were deemed unfit because they had condemned China 's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement .
5322	The committee is formulating Hong Kong 's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997 , and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they `` abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong . ''
5324	Israeli officials confirmed that Energy Minister Moshe Shahal and his Canadian counterpart , Jake Epp , discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $ 1.1 billion Canadian nuclear reactor for producing electricity .
5329	South Korean government officials said they do n't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw , but it can `` offer experience . ''
5332	Earlier this year , Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $ 600 million a year .
5335	Most of the proposals are in tourism , basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects , he said .
5336	Under the debt-equity program , potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at , and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers .
5338	A song by American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed black leader Nelson Mandela was banned from South African state radio and television .
5341	The `` anti-hooligan '' law , which would deprive troublemakers of cards , must be ratified by the House of Lords and is expected to become effective early next year .
5342	A federal judge ruled that Imelda Marcos was n't brought to the U.S. against her will and that marital privileges , which protect spouses from incriminating each other , do n't apply in her case .
5343	As a result , Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence .
5344	Mrs. Marcos had claimed that she did n't have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege .
5345	In 1988 , a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband , Ferdinand Marcos , the ousted president of the Philippines , fled the Philippines for Hawaii , they were charged with racketeering , conspiracy , obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $ 100 million from their homeland .
5350	For instance , the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts .
5351	The U.S. has charged that the Marcoses ' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the Philippines , Hong Kong , the U.S. and other countries .
5352	On the allegation of kidnapping , Judge Keenan wrote , `` The suggestion that Mrs. Marcos was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation . ''
5365	U.S. . AND BRITISH LAW FIRMS announce rare joint venture in Tokyo .
5366	Sidley & Austin , a leading Chicago-based law firm , and Ashurst Morris Crisp , a midsized London firm of solicitors , are scheduled today to announce plans to open a joint office in Tokyo .
5367	The firms will be registered under Japanese law as foreign legal consultants and their practice with Japanese clients will be limited to advising them on matters of foreign law .
5368	The office may also be able to advise foreign and multinational clients on international law and general matters .
5369	The office will provide `` one-stop shopping '' for Japanese financial institutions and other clients seeking advice on access to the world capital markets , according to A. Bruce Schimberg , Sidley 's senior banking specialist , who will move to Tokyo from Chicago to open the office next year .
5370	The Sidley-Ashurst venture will also be staffed by another Sidley partner specializing in corporate law , a partner from Ashurst concentrating on acquisitions and a Japanese attorney .
5371	The office will tap the resources of Sidley 's 700 lawyers in the U.S. , London and Singapore as well as the 400 Ashurst staff members in London and Brussels .
5377	The union sued the state in November 1985 , alleging that it intentionally segregated job classifications by sex and paid employees in predominantly female jobs less than males in comparable jobs .
5382	One of the largest law firms in central New Jersey has been created through the merger of Norris , McLaughlin & Marcus , a 41-lawyer firm , and Manger , Kalison , McBride & Webb , a health-care specialty law firm with 14 lawyers .
5383	Norris McLaughlin is a general-practice firm that has expanded recently into such specialties as banking , labor and environmental work .
5389	He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .
5390	Richard Avena , executive director of the Texas Civil Liberties Union , called the proposal `` political gimmickry , '' and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue .
5392	The bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of 15 % or more of an airline 's stock if the purchase threatened safety , reduced the carrier 's ability to compete , or put the airline under foreign control .
5400	No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first , so younger employees -- often the most enthusiastic and innovative -- seldom spoke up at all .
5401	But in 1986 , the badges and the `` do n't speak out of turn '' rule were abolished -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train .
5402	In recent years , Nissan has instituted flex-time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually , even in blue jeans .
5403	A rule forbidding staffers to own competitors ' cars has been lifted , and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas .
5408	This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan , after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits , has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits , ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao , a minicar sold only in Japan .
5411	The big one : A company 's culture ca n't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge .
5416	Nissan , Japan 's second-largest auto maker and the world 's fourth-largest , was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival , Toyota Motor Corp. , but also by Honda Motor Co. , the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative pipsqueak in Japan .
5419	Worst of all , Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting , cronyism and corporate rigidity .
5426	Desperately hoping to spark sales , Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships .
5433	He liked the well-lighted lobby display of Honda 's cars and trucks so much that he had Nissan 's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished .
5436	Such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced , but they seem to be genuine -- so much so , in fact , that some older employees have resisted .
5437	Nissan handled the die-hards in a typically Japanese fashion : They were n't fired but instead `` were neglected , '' says Kouji Hori , the personnel manager at the Nissan Technical Center .
5440	Since then , Nissan also has launched new versions of the $ 13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car .
5441	The restyled 300ZX costs as much as $ 33,000 and is squared off against the Porche 944 , which begins at $ 41,900 .
5442	Besides new styling , the new Nissans have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems .
5445	One is the Pao , a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy-eyed look .
5446	Nissan initially planned to sell just 10,000 Paos , but sales have passed 50,000 , and there 's a one-year waiting list for the car .
5449	The chairs are S-Cargo seats , and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the Pao 's oversized speedometer .
5450	All these vehicles have sharply improved Nissan 's morale and image -- but have n't done much for its market share .
5452	Strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide , but even the 25 % market share that Nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade .
5453	Nissan concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market-share losses in Japan until at least 1995 , and even that timetable might prove optimistic .
5457	But even that brings Nissan only to the share it had in 1987 , and leaves the company behind its high of 5.5 % in 1980 and 1982 .
5460	In compact and subcompact cars , the bread-and-butter sales generators for Japanese auto makers , Nissan still trails Toyota and Honda .
5462	The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with Honda 's hugely successful Accord and Toyota 's Camry .
5463	But this year , Honda has revamped the Accord and made it a midsized car .
5464	Nissan instead has kept its new Stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6 % ; at $ 11,450 , Stanza prices start $ 749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine .
5468	Even if the new Stanza succeeds , Nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment , where its Sentra does n't measure up to the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla .
5470	At the opposite end of the market , Nissan launches its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. 8 -- three years after Honda pioneered Japanese luxury cars and two months after Toyota 's Lexus went on sale .
5472	The ads featured fences , rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves .
5473	The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising .
5475	Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $ 38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month , sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan .
5479	`` Infiniti is Nissan 's big business move for the 21st century , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away , '' Mr. Oka says .
5483	Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales .
5488	Nissan is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world 's key economic arenas -- the U.S. , Japan and Europe .
5489	That gives it an enviable strategic advantage , at least until its rivals catch up , but also plenty of managerial headaches .
5496	`` We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company , and there are many more things to do , '' President Kume says .
5498	As expected , Warner Bros . Records said it agreed to form a recorded-music and music-publishing joint venture with former MCA Records Chairman Irving Azoff .
5499	Warner said it will provide financing for the venture , but did n't disclose terms .
5500	Mr. Azoff has n't named the company yet , but any records it produces will be distributed by Warner .
5502	Mr. Azoff resigned as head of MCA Records , a unit of MCA Inc. , in September , and had been discussing a joint venture with both Warner and MCA .
5504	President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early December , a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home .
5505	The White House is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements .
5506	Rather , senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. Bush 's request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders .
5507	The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3 , alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea .
5508	The unusual seaborne meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer , at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed .
5509	In announcing the meeting yesterday , Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
5510	Instead , he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get `` better acquainted '' and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda .
5511	Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders .
5512	Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home .
5513	American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics , whose support he needs .
5514	For his part , Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe .
5518	Mr. Bush said that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers .
5519	`` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. Bush said .
5522	If the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level U.S.-Soviet meetings , their talks would include human rights , Soviet reforms , regional disputes , relations with allies , economic cooperation , arms control , and joint efforts to fight narcotics , terrorism and pollution .
5527	In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005 .
5529	But one Bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the Soviet economy or other issues .
5530	`` Do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arms control , or the environment , '' he said .
5534	It 's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly . ''
5535	Aside from the Soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms , one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions .
5536	Western analysts say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact .
5542	But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides , and word of it did n't reach many second-level officials until the past few days .
5545	Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary , who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev 's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe , a senior aide said .
5550	State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties .
5551	BNL also said that its board had approved `` after an in-depth discussion , '' a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches .
5553	Bank of Italy has also ordered BNL to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses , and the Rome bank has outlined a 3 trillion lire capital-raising operation .
5555	Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities .
5556	Of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti-abortionists , anti-nuclear activists , animal rights protesters , college students concerned about racism , anti-apartheid groups , various self-styled `` environmentalists '' and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against AIDS .
5557	Maybe he did n't start it , but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today .
5559	Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . ''
5560	I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them .
5561	It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change .
5562	Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
5563	There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it .
5567	It is true that both are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them .
5568	Lawful demonstrations , such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others , are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government .
5569	Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking .
5570	The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience ; but , before we get on with that , let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations .
5571	They are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute .
5572	The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics .
5573	Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews .
5574	At best , demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative ; at worst , they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking .
5575	Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile .
5576	Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing , auto trashing , arson , window breaking , looting , pocket picking and general hooliganism .
5580	Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like .
5582	The crimes may appear small , but the prices can be huge .
5584	Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car .
5585	The protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the authorities carry them away .
5589	The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor , but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal .
5591	The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups .
5593	The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige .
5594	The demonstrators have been non-violent , but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute .
5595	It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience , so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of `` chickens coming home to roost . ''
5597	Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters .
5599	I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country 's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat .
5600	Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience , which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war they characterized as `` immoral , '' weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict .
5601	Even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections , thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists .
5602	It is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine-tuned .
5603	Worse , it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the United States to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in Vietnam .
5605	The precedent having been set , who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the U.S. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over ?
5607	Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be required .
5609	Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ?
5612	If you have not , it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course .
5614	Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise $ 800 million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake .
5617	`` I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline '' of the revenue-raising plan , said a spokesman for the governor , after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake-relief question .
5618	The tax increase -- on top of the current six-cent per dollar sales tax -- would become effective this Dec. 1 and expire Dec. 31 , 1990 .
5620	Some legislators expressed concern that a gas-tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas-tax-increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider next June .
5622	The consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $ 108.8 million , or $ 1.35 a share , from $ 90.5 million , or $ 1.12 a share , a year ago .
5624	After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings , Kimberly-Clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America , Brazil and Korea .
5625	Those gains came from higher prices , particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products , and from increased sales , primarily for feminine-care products , the company said .
5627	The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period , including $ 11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama .
5628	In the 1989 period also , interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago .
5629	In the first nine months , profit rose 10 % to $ 313.2 million , or $ 3.89 a share , from $ 283.9 million , or $ 3.53 a share .
5633	This is the year : Unsuspecting filers of 1988 personal returns are being picked randomly for thorough audits to help the IRS update its criteria for enforcement , audit selection , and use of resources .
5635	The 1988-return project starts Jan. 1 and is to be done by May 31 , 1991 .
5636	Specially trained IRS agents will look for under-reported income and unsupported deductions and credits .
5637	The agents will make more than routine inquiries about such items as marital status and dependents ; they want to look at living standards and business assets .
5638	But they also are to see that taxpayers get all allowable tax benefits and to ask if filers who sought IRS aid were satisfied with it .
5639	Courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to TCMP audits , but the IRS will excuse from the fullscale rigors anyone who was audited without change for either 1986 or 1987 .
5642	Long-debated proposals to simplify the more than 150 civil penalties and make them fairer and easier to administer are in the House tax bill .
5645	Sen. Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark. -RRB- , a leader on the issue who generally backs the House plan , wants some changes -- for one , separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed , not a single penalty .
5646	He would ease the proposed penalties for delayed payroll-tax deposits and for faulty Form 1099 and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily .
5649	The 1988 tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out IRS duties to protect taxpayers ' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes .
5652	In 1989 , Illinois , Kansas , Ohio , Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws , the Federation of Tax Administrators , a state officials ' group , reports ; the features vary .
5654	One group is the Committee on State Taxation , which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce .
5655	The group 's Mark Cahoon says its efforts begun in 1989 have led to the introduction of bills in Massachusetts , Minnesota and Colorado to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers .
5659	Also unaltered : 12 cents for charitable activities and nine cents for medical and moving costs .
5660	IRA BALANCES could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by Reps. Chandler -LRB- R. , Wash . -RRB- and Andrews -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- .
5663	South Carolina 's congressional delegation has entered Senate and House bills to provide special casualty-loss treatment and other tax relief for timber growers in the hurricane disaster areas .
5664	HE RODE HIS HOBBY , but he could n't milk it , the Tax Court says .
5665	The court often weighs deductions of sideline-business costs : Do they stem from a profit-seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby ?
5667	Charles O. Givens of Mount Vernon , Ind. - investment broker , ex-accountant , and son of a former stable owner - bred Tennessee Walking Horses for six years , raised cattle for four , and never made a profit on either .
5668	He claimed losses totaling $ 42,455 -- and the IRS denied them all .
5669	Special Judge Galloway noted that Givens managed horse-breeding in a businesslike way : He kept detailed accounts , practiced soil conservation , enhanced his experience by consulting experts , spent several hours a day doing chores , and dropped the sideline when his best brood mare died .
5670	Yet he took little businesslike care with his cattle : He had no prior experience and did n't seek business counsel about them .
5671	The judge said Givens may deduct his $ 30,180 of losses from horse breeding , but rejected the $ 12,275 in deductions from the cattle operation .
5673	The IRS already is doing intensive TCMP audits of 19,000 returns for 1987 and fiscal 1988 filed by corporations with under $ 10 million in assets ... .
5675	The U.S. and Finland signed an income-tax treaty , subject to ratification .
5676	An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $ 60 million and $ 100 million in back pay , a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization .
5678	It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the carrier 's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air .
5689	`` This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee , '' he said .
5691	Eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts .
5694	The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots ' contract .
5698	Eastern has disputed the claim , but a federal district court , an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots .
5701	Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots , resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union .
5703	Ironically , many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier , which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9 .
5704	About 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work .
5706	The general public may not know his name , but he 's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles : A marketing consultant , he pioneered slashing ad agency commissions , to the delight of advertising clients and the dismay of agencies .
5708	Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum , 62 , vice chairman of professional services , reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel , chairman and chief executive officer .
5713	Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country , including Nissan , Toyota , Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan .
5714	At Backer Spielvogel , he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies ; aside from agency compensation issues , he helped Nissan , for example , come up with its positioning and pricing for its new Infiniti line .
5723	And with Al 's record of being a delver and a detail guy , you can see how the two fit , '' said Alan Gottesman , an analyst with PaineWebber .
5725	When the announcement came out , `` I picked up the phone and said , ` Why do n't you come to us ? ' '' Mr. Spielvogel said .
5726	Mr. Achenbaum , who had been considering paring down his firm or merging it with another small consulting outfit , soon agreed .
5727	The two men are longtime friends and tennis partners , having met about 25 years ago .
5729	He spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies , but became best-known for chipping away at ad agency compensation .
5739	Mr. Spielvogel said Mr. Achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion , merchandising , publicity and other marketing outlets , and to integrate those services .
5740	He will concentrate on , among others , J.P. Morgan and Hyundai .
5741	Mr. Achenbaum helped Morgan in its recent agency search , and he has a long relationship with Hyundai , which is having severe troubles , including declining sales .
5742	`` The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising , and going towards other services , '' Mr. Spielvogel said .
5744	Our mission is to help our clients grow , and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that . ''
5751	J. Nicholas Hahn , Cotton Inc. 's president and chief executive , was an outspoken critic of WPP Group 's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year .
5752	During the takeover , Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP 's bid were successful , but he did n't .
5754	The campaign replaces its `` Take Comfort in Cotton '' ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts .
5755	For years , the company 's ads were tied in with pitches for Cannon sheets or Martex towels , for example , and an announcer at the end of the ads would tell customers where to `` find the true performance label . ''
5756	With the new TV spots , Ogilvy & Mather has opted for a family style with lots of laughter , hugs and tears .
5758	Cotton Inc. will spend nearly $ 2 million on broadcasting on Thanksgiving Day alone , advertising on such programs as `` Good Morning America , '' `` Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade '' and the NFL holiday game .
5761	Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group , which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market .
5762	Clients include Miller Brewing Co. and General Motors .
5763	Mr. Mingo was hospitalized Sept. 23 and died Monday , according to Samuel J. Chisholm , the agency 's president and chief operating officer .
5766	Omnicom Group Inc. , New York , reported third-quarter net income rose 54 % to $ 5.6 million , or 22 cents a share , from $ 3.6 million , or 15 cents a share , a year earlier .
5768	Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew , Singapore 's leader and one of Asia 's leading statesmen for 30 years , recently announced his intention to retire next year -- though not necessarily to end his influence .
5769	The prime minister , whose hair is thinning and gray and whose face has a perpetual pallor , nonetheless continues to display an energy , a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other Asian leaders dare say only privately .
5770	The 66-year-old Mr. Lee recently spent an hour discussing the state of Asia and the world with two Journal reporters in his plainly furnished , wood-paneled office .
5775	`` It took Zhao Ziyang -LRB- former premier and party chief -RRB- 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile , part being rusticated and part missing . ''
5777	`` That 's very sad for China and for Asia because China could have been a good engine for growth , not just for Hong Kong and Taiwan but for Japan , Korea and the rest of Asia . ''
5778	On similarities between China and the Soviet Union : `` In important particulars , the Soviets are different from the Chinese .
5782	Asked if the Soviets , like Chinese officials , wo n't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control , Mr. Lee said , `` I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the Chinese -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world . ''
5786	On Asia-Pacific prosperity : `` If America can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15 years , with adjustments , and Japan can grow and not cut back , and so too , Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , ASEAN , Australia and New Zealand -- then in 15 years , the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves . ''
5790	Asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among Asia-Pacific nations , which will be discussed Nov. 6 and 7 at a ministerial meeting in Canberra , Mr. Lee said the goal `` is to have a free and open world trading system . ''
5794	I think the earlier strident notes struck by -LCB- U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert -RCB- Mosbacher and -LCB- U.S. Trade Representative -RCB- Carla Hills have been more rounded .
5795	I believe the U.S. is becoming more patient and circumspect , '' he said .
5797	The total relationship , as Mr. Lee sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits , the investments the Japanese are making in the U.S. in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and capital . ''
5800	On U.S. military presence in Asia : Asked if his offer to allow the American military to use facilities in Singapore would help preserve America 's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines , he said , `` What we have done is make it easier for the Philippines to continue to host American bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in Asia or in Southeast Asia .
5802	We think it is n't such a great burden , that it carries no stigma , and we are prepared to do it . ''
5804	I really do not understand how it is that Filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they need .
5811	I do n't feel down or done in because I show British serials on my television network or read their books .
5813	`` But the Filipinos and the Americans , when I talk to them , there 's so much passion about Filipino manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the Americans and so on .
5814	The occasional Englishman tries to put on airs but we let it pass ... .
5816	Mr. Lee added that the Filipinos are `` making it very difficult '' for the U.S. military presence to last beyond five or 10 years .
5818	I suppose sooner or later , the Japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side .
5823	On Cambodia : `` Let 's assume that -LCB- former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom -RCB- Sihanouk does what the press wants him to do and joins up with -LCB- Vietnamese-backed Cambodian leader -RCB- Hun Sen .
5825	Can Sihanouk and Hun Sen knock off the Khmer Rouge still supported by China ?
5831	The Chinese can not be seen to have made use of the Khmer Rouge and then discard them . ''
5834	Everything looked good as neurosurgeon Walter Levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's spinal tumor at the Cleveland Clinic in 1978 .
5836	The shocks generated nerve impulses that traveled via spine to brain and showed up clearly on a brain-wave monitor , indicating no damage to the delicate spinal tissue .
5840	Dr. Levy 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe , a device that he and dozens of U.S. researchers are studying with great hope .
5841	Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery , the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis .
5843	The probe , which is painless , non-invasive and apparently harmless , employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain .
5844	If positioned over the brain 's motor-control area , the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles , making , say , a finger twitch .
5847	`` All we could do was tell a patient , ` squeeze my fingers as hard as you can ' or ` raise your arm . '
5850	In the 1960s , Mayo Clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs .
5853	Since then , at least two commercial versions have been put on the U.S. market , and an estimated 500 have been sold .
5855	`` We do n't feel we can use -LCB- the devices -RCB- routinely in surgery yet , but we 're getting close , '' says Dr. Levy , who is now with the University of Pittsburgh .
5866	At least two companies , Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick , Wash. , and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford , Conn. , now sell versions of the magnetic devices .
5867	The machines , which at $ 12,500 are inexpensive by medical standards , have n't been approved in the U.S. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand , legs and other non-brain areas .
5871	The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts , says Dr. Tacker , whose prototype was dubbed the `` Tacker whacker . ''
5874	Similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke patients ' brains regroup -- a first step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation .
5875	Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines .
5880	`` Trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories , '' such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes .
5881	He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory .
5882	Both the SUNY team and researchers at the National Magnet Laboratory in Cambridge , Mass. , are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators .
5883	Among other things , the stronger devices may be able to summon forth half-forgotten memories and induce mood changes , neurologists say .
5884	Du Pont Co. , Hewlett-Packard Co. and Los Alamos National Laboratory said they signed a three-year , $ 11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research .
5885	The collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics , the companies said .
5886	The materials , discovered during the past three years , conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller , faster computers and other new technologies .
5887	Joint-research programs have proliferated as U.S. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia , especially in Japan .
5889	The Wilmington , Del. , chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and with Argonne National Laboratory .
5895	The retailer said the securities are expected to be rated triple-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. and Aaa by Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
5907	Still , 20 Japanese companies , including giants such as Sanyo Industries Corp. , Matsushita Electronics Components Corp. and Sony Corp. have set up shop in the state of Northern Baja California .
5909	Mexico , with its desperate need for investment , and Japan , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match .
5911	Conservative Japanese investors are put off by what they consider Mexico 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits .
5919	Mr. Salinas 's unpopular Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , faces congressional elections in 1991 .
5920	For the PRI to stand a chance , Mr. Salinas has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth .
5921	But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange .
5924	`` The Japanese will come to Mexico , but not immediately , '' says Kazushige Suzuki , director-general of the Japanese External Trade Organization in Mexico .
5930	`` There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of -LRB- Mexico 's -RRB- government that there is a lot of Japanese money waiting behind the gate , and that by slightly opening the gate , that money will enter Mexico .
5934	Mexico is sending a number of missions to Japan looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications , petrochemicals or tourism .
5941	Mr. Nakamura cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in Baja and has been trying for eight years to get around Mexican restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property .
5942	He could develop the beach through a trust , but instead is trying have his grandson become a naturalized Mexican so his family gains direct control .
5944	`` We must do more to help the Japanese here in Baja if we want them to invest elsewhere , '' says Mr. Ruffo , the governor-elect of the National Action Party and himself a succesful businessman .
5947	Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of U.S. economic growth , currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar 's near-term performance .
5948	Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by Dow Jones International News Service in Frankfurt , Tokyo , London and New York expect the U.S. dollar to ease only mildly in November .
5951	In late afternoon New York trading yesterday , the dollar stood at 1.8415 West German marks , up from 1.8340 marks late Monday , and at 142.85 yen , up from 141.90 yen late Monday .
5952	A month ago , a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of October .
5954	In Tokyo Wednesday , the U.S. currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning , up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday 's Tokyo close of 142.15 yen .
5955	The average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of November and at 141.33 yen .
5956	By late January , the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around 1.8200 marks and near 142 yen .
5957	Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen , while the dollar bears see the U.S. currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen .
5959	David Owen , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy .
5960	Robert White , a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California , agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3\/4 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 13\/16 % .
5961	Fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system .
5964	He expects such a cut `` because of problems in several sectors of the economy , particularly real estate and automobiles . ''
5967	In last month 's survey , a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the U.S. and West Germany .
5968	Indeed , in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point .
5972	After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 3\/4 % .
5973	But predictions that central banks of the Group of Seven -LRB- G-7 -RRB- major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray , as the market drove the dollar downward on its own , reacting to Wall Street 's plunge and subsequent price volatility , lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing U.S. economy .
5974	G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy .
5975	Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand .
5978	`` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen .
5980	He contended that the Fed wo n't ease rates further , but predicted Bundesbank officials will relax key rates in West Germany .
5987	He predicted the U.S. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year .
5988	`` We 're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months , '' he said , noting a continuing downward trend in U.S. interest rates , a shaky stock market and `` gloomier economic times ahead '' all signal a significantly lower dollar .
5989	In the wake of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's surprise resignation and sterling 's subsequent nose-dive , most analysts had little good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects .
5995	Christopher Hill in Tokyo , Nicholas Hastings in London , Erik Kirschbaum in Frankfurt and Caitlin Randall and Douglas Appell in New York contributed to this article .
5999	The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the West German financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of Frankfurt into rival financial centers , especially London , where trading transactions is n't taxed .
6000	The tax has raised less than one billion marks -LRB- $ 545.3 million -RRB- annually in recent years , but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns .
6002	The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of 1990 and guarantees its abolition even if the current center-right coalition loses the elections in December 1990 .
6003	Earlier this year , President Bush made a final `` take-it-or-leave it '' offer on the minimum wage : an increase to $ 4.25 an hour over three years , and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job .
6006	The White House had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation .
6008	It is compromises such as this that convince Washington 's liberals that if they simply stay the course , this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues .
6010	Chemical said Steven Edelson resigned recently , but one individual close to the situation said the resignation was forced .
6015	-- Chemical named James Kennedy , a trader in swaps contracts for the bank , to assume Mr. Edelson 's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products , including swaps and interest-rate options .
6016	-- Lee Wakeman , vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess , resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at Continental Bank in Chicago .
6019	A Chemical spokeswoman said the second-quarter charge was `` not material '' and that no personnel changes were made as a result .
6021	According to individuals familiar with the situation , the Frankfurt loss stemmed from a computer program for calculating prices on forward-rate agreements that failed to envision an interest-rate environment where short-term rates were equal to or higher than long-term rates .
6022	While the incidents involving interest-rate options and forward-rate agreements are unrelated , some observers say they echo a 1987 incident in which Bankers Trust New York Corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $ 80 million .
6026	Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from Chemical 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem .
6031	The Chemical spokeswoman said the bank has examined its methodologies and internal controls .
6035	When Thomas W. Wathen went big league last year , he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security business : Pinkerton 's Inc .
6036	There was a wanted poster offering `` Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James '' and the original Pinkerton 's logo with an open eye and the inscription `` We Never Sleep , '' which inspired the phrase `` private eye . ''
6039	The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. Wathen encountered in building his closely held California Plant Protection Security Service into the largest detective and security agency in the U.S. through acquisitions .
6042	Mr. Wathen , who started his career as an Air Force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies , built his California Plant Protection from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the San Fernando Valley .
6043	He joined the firm in 1963 and bought it from the owners the next year .
6045	Yet although California Plant Protection was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles -- it still did n't have the name recognition of Pinkerton 's .
6046	So when American Brands Inc. decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations , Mr. Wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives .
6048	He could acquire a staff of loyal Pinkerton 's employees , many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm , he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he 'd wanted .
6049	Mr. Wathen also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself , who 'd spent his whole career in the security business , could run Pinkerton 's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker .
6057	He says his team could n't tell whether accounts receivable had been paid or not .
6060	One office had 19 people doing the work of three , `` and half of the employees had company automobiles . ''
6062	The acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company , Pinkerton 's , with 1987 sales of $ 410 million , and the fourth largest , California Plant Protection , with $ 250 million in sales , creating the industry 's biggest firm , which took on the Pinkerton 's name .
6063	Even after divesting itself of $ 120 million of unprofitable business , the new Pinkerton 's will have sales of about $ 610 million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2%-3 % of sales , says Lloyd Greif of Sutro & Co. in Los Angeles , which arranged the Pinkerton 's acquisition .
6072	Last year , earnings of the combined companies did n't cover debt service and Pinkerton 's was forced to borrow $ 20 million of subordinated debt .
6074	This year , Mr. Wathen says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit .
6077	The suit alleges that American Brands misrepresented the financial condition of Pinkerton 's before the sale , failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which Pinkerton 's was in default , had n't registered the Pinkerton 's name and trademark in the United Kingdom and did n't tell California Plant Protection about some labor controversies .
6078	`` We have previously had discussions with representatives of Pinkerton 's Inc. concerning the -LCB- sale of the company -RCB- and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract , '' says American Brands .
6082	`` American Brand 's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new Pinkerton 's in an amount as yet -LCB- to be -RCB- determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained , '' the suit charges .
6085	Although investigations now account for only about 5 % of Pinkerton 's total revenue , that side of the business has traditionally been the more `` glamorous '' of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value .
6090	Milk sold to the nation 's dairy plants and dealers averaged $ 14.50 for each hundred pounds , up 50 cents from September and up $ 1.50 from October 1988 , the department said .
6091	Commercial vegetables , led by lettuce and tomatoes , rose 19 % in October ; oranges and other fruits rose 5 % .
6094	Hogs rose $ 3.40 to $ 46.80 a hundredweight in October , while beef cattle slipped 80 cents to $ 67.40 for each hundred pounds and calves dropped 90 cents to $ 90.20 .
6095	Soybeans averaged $ 5.28 a bushel , down 42 cents from September ; corn averaged $ 2.20 , down seven cents , and sorghum grain averaged $ 3.61 for each hundred pounds , down 19 cents , according to the department .
6096	Paramount Communications Inc. , New York , completed the sale of its Associates Corp. consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of Ford Motor Co. for $ 3.35 billion .
6099	Paramount said the sale `` completes the strategic restructuring '' it began in 1983 , and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses .
6102	Sea Containers Ltd. , in a long-awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid , said it will sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece .
6103	Together with the 3.6 million shares currently controlled by management , subsidiaries and directors , the completed tender offer would give Sea Containers a controlling stake .
6104	Describing itself as `` asset rich , '' Sea Containers said it will move immediately to sell two ports , various ferries , ferry services , containers , and other investments .
6108	In late May , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC , launched a $ 50-a-share , or $ 777 million , tender offer for the Hamilton , Bermuda-based Sea Containers .
6109	In mid-August , the companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple Holdings Ltd. , sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million .
6115	The company said its directors , management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and wo n't tender any of their shares under the offer .
6116	Sea Containers said the offer will proceed after the Bermuda Supreme Court lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares .
6117	That injunction resulted from litigation between Temple and Sea Containers last May .
6118	The company said the court has indicated it will make a decision on or about Nov. 27 .
6120	You 'd think all the stories about well-heeled communities and developers getting HUD grants would prompt Congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies .
6128	But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have in mind for housing .
6133	Because a purchaser can use an FHA loan to finance all points and closing costs , the FHA can wind up lending more than a house is worth .
6134	If housing prices continue to fall , many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses .
6138	A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations .
6142	None of the grants had been requested by HUD , judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing .
6144	This week , a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce 's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses : the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects .
6145	The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem -- and a part that 's gone .
6146	`` If HUD is to be reformed , '' it concluded , Members of Congress will `` have to start looking into , and doing something about , the practices of their colleagues . ''
6150	Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms , and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage-grinder .
6153	Under the plan , Gillette South Africa will sell manufacturing facilities in Springs , South Africa , and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , an affiliate of Anglo American Corp. , a South African company .
6155	A final agreement has not been signed , and the moves will not have a material effect on the company , Gillette said .
6156	The company said it is part of a continuing world-wide restructuring in which it has downsized or sold operations in several countries .
6157	Gillette said its continued presence in South Africa `` enables it to make meaningful contributions to South African society , to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates . ''
6159	About 60 % of the work force will continue with Gillette or transfer to Twins Pharmaceuticals , the company said .
6160	The Soviet legislature approved a 1990 budget yesterday that halves its huge deficit with cuts in defense spending and capital outlays while striving to improve supplies to frustrated consumers .
6162	A proposal to raise prices of beer , tobacco and luxuries was rejected 338-44 .
6163	Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the legislators they had made a good start , but that the most difficult work was still ahead .
6164	The Tass news agency said the 1990 budget anticipates income of 429.9 billion rubles -LRB- US$ 693.4 billion -RRB- and expenditures of 489.9 billion rubles -LRB- US$ 790.2 billion -RRB- .
6167	Officials proposed a cut in the defense budget this year to 70.9 billion rubles -LRB- US$ 114.3 billion -RRB- from 77.3 billion rubles -LRB- US$ 125 billion -RRB- as well as large cuts in outlays for new factories and equipment .
6168	Tass said the final budget and economic plan calls for a sharp increase in the production of consumer goods .
6169	Trial and Terror
6171	But often nothing 's resolved , To my frustration and fury : With pros and cons in limbo , I feel like a hung jury .
6176	Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co. will sell its contract-drilling business , and took a $ 50.9 million loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter because of the planned sale .
6177	The New Orleans oil and gas exploration and diving operations company added that it does n't expect any further adverse financial impact from the restructuring .
6178	In the third quarter , the company , which is 61%-owned by Murphy Oil Corp. of Arkansas , had a net loss of $ 46.9 million , or 91 cents a share , compared with a restated loss of $ 9 million , or 18 cents a share , a year ago .
6182	It has long been rumored that Ocean Drilling would sell the unit to concentrate on its core oil and gas business .
6186	Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year .
6187	The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus .
6188	Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance .
6189	Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program , and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system .
6190	But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine .
6195	Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain cost-control measures .
6196	Partly in response , a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support .
6199	By contrast , Japan 's equal 6.7 % of GNP , a nation 's total output of goods and services .
6200	Management and labor worry that the gap makes U.S. companies less competitive .
6202	`` The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength , '' complains Walter Maher , a Chrysler health-and-benefits specialist .
6203	Labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers .
6204	Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against Pittston Co. and Nynex Corp .
6205	In their new contract this year , American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed to look for `` prompt and lasting national solutions '' to rising health-care costs .
6208	`` They hope they can buy some government cost discipline , '' but this is a false hope , Mr. Schramm says .
6210	So far neither the Bush administration nor Congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care .
6212	Congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988 , which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage .
6213	A bipartisan commission established by Congress and headed by Sen. John Rockefeller -LRB- D. , W.Va . -RRB- is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next March 1 .
6214	A quadrennial commission appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general .
6220	Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups , particularly the American Medical Association , and perhaps from the public as well , if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care .
6221	The NAM embraces efforts , which both the administration and the medical profession have begun , to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines .
6222	Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures .
6223	HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25 % of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary .
6224	Limiting care wo n't be easy or popular .
6226	This will `` require us to define -- and redefine -- what is ` necessary ' or ` appropriate ' care .
6227	This involves trade-offs and -LCB- it -RCB- cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is ` necessary . ' ''
6229	In addition , it 's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way to slow health-care spending .
6233	The fasteners , nuts and bolts , are sold to the North American auto market .
6237	Stelco said it has an option to lease a 350,000-square-foot building in Brantford and proposes to spend 24.5 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 20.9 million -RRB- on the facility .
6238	The three existing plants and their land will be sold .
6240	Terms call for First Security to issue about 0.55 share of its stock for each Deseret share held , or a total of about 550,000 First Security shares .
6242	Deseret , with about $ 100 million in assets , is the parent of the Deseret Bank , which has six offices and headquarters at Pleasant Grove , Utah .
6243	The purchase price is equal to about 1.65 times Deseret 's roughly $ 10.7 million book value , or assets less liabilities .
6244	Salt Lake City-based First Security , with $ 5.4 billion in assets , said the agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval , and that it hopes to complete the transaction early next year .
6246	William R. Laidig , Nekoosa 's chairman , chief executive officer and president , characterized the $ 58-a-share bid as `` uninvited '' and said Nekoosa 's board would consider the offer `` in due course . ''
6247	T. Marshall Hahn Jr. , Georgia-Pacific 's chairman and chief executive , said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable .
6250	On Wall Street , takeover stock traders bid Nekoosa 's stock well above the Georgia-Pacific bid , assuming that Nekoosa 's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to Georgia-Pacific at a higher price -- as much as $ 75 a share , according to some estimates .
6253	Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray , Georgia-Pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed : namely , industrial companies can continue bidding for one another , but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing .
6254	`` The way the world is shaping up , the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception , '' said one trader .
6255	For the paper industry specifically , most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers , possibly involving such companies as Union Camp Corp. , Federal Paperboard Co. and Mead Corp .
6256	The analysts argued that Georgia-Pacific 's offer , the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry , ends the unwritten taboo on hostile bids , and will push managements to look closely at the industry 's several attractive takeover candidates .
6262	Based on 1988 sales , Georgia-Pacific ranked third at $ 9.51 billion , behind Weyerhaeuser Co. at $ 10 billion and International Paper Co. at $ 9.53 billion .
6266	At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects .
6267	Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities .
6273	The two companies each produce market pulp , containerboard and white paper .
6277	Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a `` significant downturn '' in the pulp and paper industry , an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings .
6281	Georgia-Pacific owns 349,900 Nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $ 15 million worth .
6284	The company 's chairman , Mr. Laidig , and a group of advisers met at the offices of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz , a law firm specializing in takeover defense .
6286	Georgia-Pacific 's advisers are Wasserstein , Perella & Co. , which stands to receive a $ 15 million fee if the takeover succeeds , and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling .
6289	In addition to the usual array of defenses , including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board , Nekoosa has another takeover defense : a Maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years .
6291	Georgia-Pacific has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maine challenging the poison pill and the Maine merger law .
6292	Nekoosa 's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it , but Georgia-Pacific is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take 90 to 120 days , and would n't affect the provisions of the Maine law .
6293	Among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for Nekoosa are International Paper , Weyerhaeuser , Canadian Pacific Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd .
6295	International Paper and Weyerhaeuser declined to comment .
6296	Canadian Pacific could n't be reached for comment , and MacMillan Bloedel said it has n't any plans to make a bid for Nekoosa .
6297	Investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates , all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations .
6298	Among paper company stocks that rallied on the Big Board because of the offer were Union Camp , up $ 2.75 to $ 37.75 , Federal Paperboard , up $ 1.75 to $ 27.875 , Mead , up $ 2.375 to $ 38.75 , and Temple Inland Inc. , up $ 3.75 to $ 62.25 .
6304	The buyers , these analysts added , could be either foreign or other U.S. concerns .
6310	Moreover , `` it 's a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a plant than to build one . ''
6314	Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the U.S. in 1986 , there have been more than 100 mergers and acquisitions within the European paper industry , he said .
6315	Lyphomed Inc. , Rosemont , Ill. , and Medco Research Inc. , Los Angeles , said the Food and Drug Administration granted full marketing approval for a new drug for the treatment of a condition in which the heart beats between 150 and 200 beats a minute .
6316	The condition , known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia , leads to dizziness and fainting .
6319	Medco Research developed the drug and licensed it to Lyphomed for sale in the U.S. and Canada .
6321	The increase in wage and benefit costs in the third quarter was greater than the 1 % rise reported for the third quarter of 1988 .
6322	`` Wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning to curl upward a little bit , '' said Audrey Freedman , a labor economist at the Conference Board , a business research organization .
6323	`` One would have thought this would have happened two or three years ago as the labor market tightened .
6324	It is a considerably delayed reaction and it 's not a severe one at all , '' she added .
6326	In the 12 months ended in September , wages and salaries of private-sector workers rose 4.4 % , while health insurance costs spurted by 13.7 % .
6329	The overall private-sector employment cost index , which includes both wages and benefits , rose 4.7 % in the 12 months ended in September , compared with 4.5 % for both the 12 months ended in June and the 12 months ended September 1988 .
6332	In the third quarter , wages and salaries in all private industry rose 1.2 % , compared with 1 % increases in both the second quarter and in the third quarter of 1988 .
6334	For private-sector union workers , the cost of wages and benefits rose 0.9 % in the third quarter .
6338	Including employees of state and local -- but not the federal -- governments , the employment cost index rose 1.6 % in the third quarter , compared with a 1.3 % rise in the same quarter in 1988 .
6341	It rose 4.8 % for the 12 months ended in June and 4.7 % in the 12 months ended in September 1988 .
6344	Under the plan , DeSoto said it will sell certain assets and businesses that do n't meet strategic and profitability objectives .
6345	The Des Plaines , Ill. , chemical coatings concern , which has about 2,000 employees world-wide , said it plans to sell its domestic rigid container packaging and flexible adhesives businesses , and its Chicago Heights , Ill. , resin plant .
6349	StatesWest , which has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , said it may purchase more Mesa stock or make a tender offer directly to Mesa shareholders .
6350	StatesWest had proposed acquiring Mesa for $ 7 a share and one share of a new series of StatesWest 6 % convertible preferred stock it values at $ 3 a share .
6352	StatesWest serves 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada .
6353	Mesa flies to 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas .
6364	Some traders point out that as the big brokerage firms back out of program trading for their own accounts or for clients , opportunities increase for others to engage in the controversial practice .
6367	A slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many traders and analysts .
6372	If the national survey confirms a pickup in the manufacturing sector , it could further depress bond prices while bolstering stock prices and the dollar .
6374	Although the Treasury is expected to announce details of its November quarterly refunding operation today , the Nov. 79 schedule could be delayed unless Congress and the president act soon to lift the nation 's debt ceiling .
6380	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained less than a quarter of a point , or less than $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 of face amount .
6383	In late afternoon New York trading , the dollar was at 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen compared with 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen late Monday .
6391	QVC agreed to pay $ 19 and one-eighth QVC share for each of CVN 's 20 million fully diluted shares .
6393	Among them , Home Shopping , QVC and CVN already control most of that young and fast-growing market , which last year had sales of about $ 1.4 billion .
6395	The Los Angeles thrift holding company said it had a loss of $ 92.2 million , or $ 6.98 a share , for the quarter ended Sept. 30 .
6396	Coast earned $ 10.2 million , or 67 cents a share , in the year-ago quarter .
6399	It includes removing $ 242 million in good will from the books , issuing $ 150 million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for $ 52 million in convertible bonds .
6400	During the third quarter , the company charged about $ 46 million against earnings in reducing goodwill , added $ 20 million to its general loan loss reserves and established a $ 30 million reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio .
6403	The campaign , a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights , does n't mention cigarettes or smoking ; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since 1971 .
6406	The company 's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low , although its array of brands -- including Maxwell House coffee , Jell-O , Cheez Whiz , and Miller beer -- blanket supermarket shelves .
6408	The initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows .
6410	Until now , its corporate ads , mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts , have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines .
6411	`` Most people -- whether in Toledo , Tucson or Topeka -- have n't got a clue who we are , '' says Guy L. Smith , Philip Morris 's vice president of corporate affairs .
6413	Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial , which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression , is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers .
6414	Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments , `` this has nothing to do with cigarettes , nor will it ever , '' the spokesman says .
6416	`` I 'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of American culture and political freedom and in fact it 's a killer , '' says Michael Pertschuk , former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a tobacco-industry critic .
6419	These include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the First Amendment , and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights .
6421	Many marketers say Philip Morris 's approach will be effective , but they agree that the ads ' implied smoking message is unmistakable .
6423	`` This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise . ''
6425	If you can do that and at the same time send a message that supports your business , that 's brilliant . ''
6426	RJR Nabisco Inc. and American Brands Inc. say they have no plans to follow Philip Morris 's lead .
6429	`` They are n't showing James Madison taking a puff or lighting up , '' says Laurence Tribe , a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University .
6432	The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 4.26 , or about 0.94 % , to 455.63 .
6436	The Big Board 's composite index was up more than 1.4 % , and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.6 % .
6439	The Financial Index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2.19 to 447.76 .
6440	Other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the Transportation Index , up 7.55 to 475.35 , and the Utility Index , up 8.68 to 730.37 .
6443	Microsoft added 2 1\/8 to 81 3\/4 and Oracle Systems rose 1 1\/2 to 23 1\/4 .
6446	Technology stocks bore the brunt of the OTC market 's recent sell-off , and traders say it 's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around .
6451	But increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dips and swings .
6452	The stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows .
6457	The group is divided primarily between software , semiconductors and computers .
6458	While computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry , many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market .
6460	The technology group is also split between large companies and small , with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip issues in the institutional marketplace , while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults , analysts say .
6464	That index , which contains technology companies with annual revenues of $ 200 million or less , gained 17.97 % by Sept. 30 this year -- still lagging the S&P 500 , but leading larger technology firms .
6470	He said that investors will scour the October employment report , due out Friday , for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates .
6471	On the other hand , Mr. Jennison noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted yesterday .
6477	The announcement effectively removes the British government as an impediment to a takeover of the company , which is being stalked by General Motors and Ford .
6488	Dycom Industries gained 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 after it said it agreed to buy Ansco & Associates and two affiliates for cash and stock .
6497	The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in Hawaii and Alaska .
6498	Assuming final enactment this month , the prohibition will take effect 96 days later , or in early February .
6500	But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $ 3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs .
6501	The additional spending pushes the measure more than $ 2 billion above its prescribed budget ceiling , and the House Appropriations Committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today .
6502	The separate $ 67 billion bill sent to the White House had budget difficulties , too , but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in Congress and the administration itself .
6503	No single bill this year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and , apart from the space station , the measure incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
6506	Separately , the bill gives authority to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the government under the so-called Section 235 home-ownership program for lower-income families .
6507	This provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients ' portfolios .
6508	But the promise of at least $ 15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere .
6509	The estimated $ 1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year 's level , and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16 % to nearly $ 12.4 billion .
6510	A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits .
6513	And while pursuing these initiatives , Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical care .
6514	The result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs , and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal 1991 .
6520	Sen. Pete Domenici -LRB- R. , N.M. -RRB- , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , used his influence to preserve more than $ 132,000 in subsidies for air service to Sante Fe , N.M. , and more than $ 2.1 million would go for service to eight communities in the western Nebraska district of GOP Rep. Virginia Smith on the House Appropriations Committee .
6523	But given the few number of users , the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $ 193 , according to House and Senate appropriations committees .
6524	The House action yesterday came as the Senate remained mired in difficulties over a $ 17.25 billion measure covering the budgets for the State , Commerce , and Justice departments in fiscal 1990 .
6525	The compromise bill passed the House last week but has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , which jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the State Department .
6527	House and Senate appropriators sought to establish a Nov. 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed .
6530	The Dallas oil and gas concern said that $ 10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company 's $ 8.1 million of existing bank debt , to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock , and to purchase a 10 % net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders , National Canada Corp .
6531	The remaining $ 40 million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions , the company said .
6532	Ted Eubank , Coda 's president , said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point , with 85 % of the company 's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment .
6533	The company put up `` virtually all '' of its oil and gas properties as collateral , he said .
6534	General Dynamics Corp. was given an $ 843 million Air Force contract for F-16 aircraft and related equipment .
6536	Southern Air Transport Inc. won $ 47.5 million in Air Force and Navy contracts for transportation services .
6543	Throw in its railroad , minerals , pipeline and oil assets , he and others argued , and the Chicago-based conglomerate should be worth 30 a share .
6546	With real estate experts Olympia & York and Samuel Zell 's Itel owning close to 40 % of Santa Fe 's stock , management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly `` maximize values . ''
6555	A compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash -- including its 44 % stake in its publicly traded pipeline -- at $ 2 billion .
6557	In addition , its railroad lost a $ 750 million antitrust suit , which is on appeal , and which analysts say could be settled for one-third that amount .
6560	Its plan , instead , is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets .
6566	And what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ? ''
6568	Mr. Schneider of Bear Stearns says he is recalculating the worth of the company 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief that he will find `` values '' of 30 a share .
6577	And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least .
6582	Business : Railroad , natural resources and real estate
6590	The offer , which values the whole of Coates at # 301 million , has already been accepted by Coates executives and other shareholders owning 12.4 % of the company .
6592	Orkem and Coates said last Wednesday that the two were considering a merger , through Orkem 's British subsidiary , Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd .
6594	The takeover would be followed by a restructuring of Orkem 's U.K. unit , including the addition of related Orkem businesses and possibly further acquisitions .
6598	Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint .
6603	Marks & Spencer PLC reported a 12 % gain in first-half pretax profit , mainly because of improving performances in the U.K. and continental Europe .
6604	In the six months ended Sept. 30 , pretax profit at the British clothing and food retailer rose to # 208.7 million -LRB- $ 330.1 million -RRB- from # 185.5 million a year ago .
6605	The results surpassed analysts ' forecasts , which averaged around # 200 million , and Marks & Spencer responded in trading on London 's Stock Exchange with an eight pence rise to 188 pence .
6606	Profit after tax and minority interest but before extraordinary items rose 12 % to # 135.2 million ; per-share earnings rose to five pence from 4.5 pence .
6609	Sales in North America and the Far East were inflated by acquisitions , rising 62 % to # 278 million .
6612	Federal and state thrift examiners said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and a California regulator described an attempted `` whitewash '' by deputies of chief federal regulator Danny Wall .
6613	In a riveting day of hearings before the House Banking Committee , the examiners described finding shredded documents , a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary , millions of dollars funneled into a Swiss bank , and a complacent attitude by Mr. Wall 's deputies , one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator .
6616	Another federal examiner , John Meek , said Lincoln 's principal owner , Charles Keating Jr. , and his family drew off at least $ 34 million from the thrift in salaries , bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the 3 1\/2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year .
6619	He said the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by Mr. Keating `` and others , '' although he did n't allege any specific violation .
6625	He called the sour loans `` appalling '' and added , `` You opened the file up and it just jumped at you . ''
6626	Leonard Bickwit , a Washington attorney for Lincoln 's parent corporation , said in an interview , `` We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers . ''
6627	`` Those who testified -LCB- yesterday -RCB- have consistently maintained that anyone who did n't agree with them is part of a coverup , a whitewash , or the subject of excessive influence , '' Mr. Bickwit said .
6628	`` We simply do n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation . ''
6629	Mr. Wall 's deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee 's hearings , which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- has used as a forum to flay Mr. Wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job .
6631	In an interview , he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss , and forced Lincoln to make an $ 18 million downward adjustment on another .
6634	The government later brought a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others .
6641	Mr. Meek said that a day or two before Lincoln 's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings , he and other examiners saw `` a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the ` Document Destruction Center . '
6644	They shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors . ''
6645	Mr. Meek said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by Lincoln , including $ 22 million paid to Credit Suisse of Switzerland , an $ 18 million interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris , a $ 17.5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company , and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company , Southbrook Holdings .
6646	Mr. Bickwit said , `` I can see why an S&L examiner would regard these as unusual activities , '' but said the overseas investments `` essentially broke even '' for the S&L .
6648	The big questions are whether the increase , effective Jan. 1 , 1990 , will stick , and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit .
6654	LTV 's planned increase , which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers , does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate .
6655	LTV confirmed the price-increase plan , saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities .
6656	A spokesman for LTV Steel , which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp. , noted that steel prices , adjusted for inflation , increased only 1.7 % between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988 , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much .
6657	At the same time , steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive .
6659	Moreover , they note that LTV may be trying to send a signal to major customers , such as Chrysler Corp. and Whirlpool Corp. , that steelmakers need more money .
6660	Both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with LTV and others .
6661	`` They -LCB- LTV -RCB- may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices , '' said Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
6662	Mr. Marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves .
6666	Steelmakers announced a round of base-price increases last year , but began offering sizable discounts over the summer .
6667	In fact , LTV was the first steelmaker to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel .
6671	The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Feb. 8 , 1990 , and May 10 , 1990 , respectively .
6672	Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
6674	Shop Television Network Inc. , of Los Angeles , said Penney agreed to continue its exclusive arrangement with Shop Television , which does the production , marketing and cable distribution for the J.C. Penney Television Shopping Channel .
6682	Bioengineers set out to duplicate that feat -- scientifically and commercially -- with new life forms .
6683	In 1953 , James Watson and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA -LRB- deoxyribonucleic acid -RRB- , the genetic key to heredity .
6684	Twenty years later , two California academics , Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer , made `` recombinant '' DNA , transplanting a toad 's gene into bacteria , which then reproduced toad genes .
6686	With $ 500 apiece and an injection of outside capital , they formed Genentech Inc .
6689	The next to be cloned , human insulin , had market potential and Genentech licensed it to Eli Lilly , which produced 80 % of the insulin used by 1.5 million U.S. diabetics .
6690	Their laboratory credentials established , Boyer and Swanson headed for Wall Street in 1980 .
6691	At the time , Genentech had only one profitable year behind it -LRB- a modest $ 116,000 on revenue of $ 2.6 million in 1979 -RRB- and no product of its own on the market .
6692	Nonetheless , the $ 36 million issue they floated in 1980 opened at $ 35 and leaped to $ 89 within 20 minutes .
6694	Boyer and Cohen , for instance , both still university researchers , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the Patent Office refused to grant it .
6695	That judgment , in turn , was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court , leaving Cohen and Boyer holding the first patents for making recombinant DNA -LRB- now assigned to their schools -RRB- .
6697	Genentech 's 1988 sales were $ 335 million , both from licensing and its own products .
6703	The Credit Lyonnais purchase , for 33,000 regular common shares and 10,000 newly created shares , is valued at about slightly more than 80 million French francs .
6704	Unocal Corp. , Los Angeles , said it and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. would create a petroleum marketing and refining general partnership in the Midwest .
6705	The joint venture , Uno-Ven Co. , would generate total annual revenue of about $ 500 million and have 1,100 employees , a Unocal spokesman said .
6706	Unocal said the venture would enable it to recover more of its refining and marketing investment and prepare for expected growth in exploration , production , chemicals and other areas .
6707	It said financing would consist of $ 250 million from a private placement obtained through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a $ 150 million revolving credit line underwritten by Chase Manhattan Bank .
6708	In addition to Unocal 's 153,000 barrel-a-day refinery near Lemont , Ill. , the new venture would control 17 distribution terminals , a lubricating-oil blending and packaging plant , and 131 company-owned Unocal service stations .
6712	In the period ended Sept. 30 , net income rose 90 % to 31.18 billion yen , or 9.34 yen a share , from 16.38 billion yen , or 5.05 yen a share .
6716	Company officials said the current robust domestic demand that has been fueling sustained economic expansion helped push up sales of products like ships , steel structures , power systems and machinery and resulted in sharply higher profit .
6717	Senate leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government 's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains President Bush 's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate .
6720	The talks between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and his GOP counterpart , Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas , are expected to resume today .
6721	Last night , after meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House , Mr. Dole proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill , now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee , and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments .
6722	Under this plan , two provisions currently in the House version of the deficit-cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic-illness insurance program and a controversial 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans -- would be made into a separate bill .
6726	Both plans would drop child-care provisions from the House version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill .
6733	Pressed by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital-gains tax cut if faced with a potential default .
6734	Price Stern Sloan Inc. said it hired an investment banking firm to assist in evaluating restructuring or merger alternatives and reported a net loss of $ 8.1 million , or $ 2.14 a share , for the third quarter ended Sept .
6735	These results compare with net income of $ 1.8 million , or 44 cents a share , for the corresponding period last year .
6736	This quarter 's loss includes pretax charges of $ 4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company 's troubled British subsidiary , and $ 3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory , publishing advances and pre-publication costs .
6737	The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser , assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives , including debt refinancing , raising capital , recapitalization , a merger or sale of the company .
6738	The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin , a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group , as an adviser .
6740	The company attributed the decrease in part to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts .
6743	Paper and forest-products stocks were especially strong , as the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa by Georgia-Pacific triggered speculation that the industry could be in for a wave of merger activity .
6749	Some 1,111 Big Board issues advanced in price and only 448 declined , while broader market averages rose sharply .
6750	Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index climbed 5.29 to 340.36 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 4.70 to 318.79 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index climbed 2.65 to
6751	Great Northern surged 20 1\/8 to 62 7\/8 , well above Georgia-Pacific 's offering price of $ 58 a share , amid speculation that other suitors for the company would surface or that the bid would be raised .
6752	Nearly 6.3 million shares , or about 11.5 % of the company 's shares outstanding , changed hands in Big Board composite trading .
6753	With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for UAL , the parent company of United Airlines , and AMR , the parent of American Airlines , analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market .
6754	The $ 3.18 billion bid , which had been rumored since last week , `` creates a better feeling that there 's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape , '' says A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research Corp .
6755	Traders and analysts alike said the market 's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage .
6756	Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading , designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index futures .
6757	`` People are looking for an ability to try and read the market , rather than be manipulated , '' said Dudley A. Eppel , manager of equity trading at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
6759	But traders also said arbitrage-related trading contributed to the market 's surge , as buy programs boosted prices shortly after the opening and sporadically through the remainder of the session .
6760	Georgia-Pacific fell 2 1\/2 to 50 7\/8 , but most paper and forest-products stocks firmed as market players speculated about other potential industry takeover targets .
6761	Within the paper sector , Mead climbed 2 3\/8 to 38 3\/4 on 1.3 million shares , Union Camp rose 2 3\/4 to 37 3\/4 , Federal Paper Board added 1 3\/4 to 23 7\/8 , Bowater gained 1 1\/2 to 27 1\/2 , Stone Container rose 1 to 26 1\/8 and Temple-Inland jumped 3 3\/4 to 62 1\/4 .
6762	Forest-products issues showing strength included Champion International , which went up 1 3\/8 to 31 7\/8 ; Weyerhaeuser , up 3\/4 to 27 1\/4 ; Louisiana-Pacific , up 1 1\/8 to 40 3\/8 , and Boise Cascade , up 5\/8 to 42 .
6764	Pfizer gained 1 7\/8 to 67 5\/8 , Schering-Plough added 2 1\/4 to 75 3\/4 , Eli Lilly rose 1 3\/8 to 62 1\/8 and Upjohn firmed 3\/4 to 38 .
6766	An advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration recommended that the agency approve Eminase , the company 's heart drug .
6767	Two rumored restructuring candidates in the oil industry moved higher : Chevron , which rose 1 3\/4 to 68 1\/4 on 3.5 million shares , and USX , which gained 1 1\/4 to 34 5\/8 .
6774	The company said it would repurchase half of its common shares at $ 70 each , sell an estimated $ 1.1 billion in assets and pay a special preferred-stock dividend to common-stock holders .
6780	Ocean Drilling & Research dropped 1 1\/4 to 21 1\/2 following news of a restructuring plan that calls for the company to reorganize its drilling business into a separate company and offer a 15 % to 20 % stake to the public .
6785	Cilcorp Inc. , Peoria , Ill. , said it agreed to acquire the environmental consulting and analytical service businesses of Hunter Environmental Services Inc. of Southport , Conn .
6790	Separately , Cilcorp said it plans to purchase as many as 1.4 million shares , or 10 % of its common stock outstanding from time to time on the open market and through privately negotiated transactions .
6792	BUSH AND GORBACHEV WILL HOLD two days of informal talks next month .
6793	The president said that he and the Kremlin leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda .
6795	Bush said that neither he nor Gorbachev expected any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
6796	The seaborne meetings wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit next spring or summer , at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed .
6797	The two leaders are expected to discuss changes sweeping the East bloc as well as human-rights issues , regional disputes and economic cooperation .
6798	Israel 's army lifted a blockade around a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank , ending a 42-day campaign of seizing cars , furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott .
6805	In Washington , the Senate voted to condemn Ortega 's threat to cancel the truce , and Bush said he would review U.S. policy toward Managua , including the possibility of renewing military aid to the rebels .
6806	Chinese leader Deng told former President Nixon that the U.S. was deeply involved in `` the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion '' that gripped Beijing last spring .
6808	Afghanistan 's troops broke through a guerrilla blockade on the strategic Salang Highway , allowing trucks carrying food and other necessities to reach Kabul after a missile attack on rebel strongholds .
6815	Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice .
6817	A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador , killing at least eight people and injuring about 30 others , including two Americans , authorities said .
6820	The balloting to decide when and how to fill the position , which replaces a collective presidency under a pact signed by the ruling Socialists and opposition groups , is to be held Nov .
6822	A spokesman for Democratic Sen. Pell of Rhode Island said , however , that the Immigration and Naturalization Service would review the stowaway 's request .
6823	Ogden Projects Inc. said net income jumped to $ 6.6 million , or 18 cents a share , in the third quarter .
6824	The Fairfield , N.J. , company , which is 92%-owned by Ogden Corp. , New York , had net of $ 1.1 million , or four cents a share , a year ago .
6828	Ogden Projects , which has interests in solid-waste recovery and hazardous-waste cleanup , said it has 13 facilities in operation , up from seven a year ago .
6829	Meanwhile , Ogden Corp. , which also has interests in building maintenance and management , reported third-quarter net income of $ 27.1 million , or 67 cents a share , more than twice the $ 13.5 million , or 34 cents a share , a year earlier .
6831	Under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders , the New York Stock Exchange is considering reinstituting a `` collar '' on program trading that it abandoned last year , according to people familiar with the Big Board .
6836	He said he is `` very surprised '' by the furor over program trading and the exchange 's role in it that has raged in recent days .
6837	Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely , as some investors want , would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . ''
6838	The exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that .
6839	Big Board officials have been under seige from both investors and the exchange 's own floor traders since the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's 190-point tumble on Oct. 13 .
6840	Mr. Phelan has n't been making public remarks in recent days , and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue .
6842	Early last year , after a 140-point , one-day drop in the Dow , the Big Board instituted the collar , which banned program trading through the Big Board 's computers whenever the Dow moved 50 points up or down in a day .
6844	`` The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions , '' meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the Big Board 's electronic trading system , Mr. Phelan said .
6847	People familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it .
6850	In stock-index arbitrage , traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets .
6856	Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists , who make markets in individual stocks , and from many companies that have shares listed on the Big Board .
6865	After another session Mr. Phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Co. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and First Boston -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said , `` Clearly , the firms want the exchange to take leadership . ''
6866	Many specialist firms resent the Big Board 's new `` basket '' product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index in one shot .
6870	Mr. Phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the Big Board is serious about curbing volatility , especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $ 200 billion in stock-index funds , which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & Poor 's 500 , and which sometimes employ program trading .
6871	The Big Board wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets , but only as long as it `` handles it intelligently , '' Mr. Phelan said .
6872	Despite what some investors are suggesting , the Big Board is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures , exchange officials said .
6874	Computers have made trading more rapid , but that can be fixed with some fine-tuning .
6878	What I 'm trying to say to people is , it 's proper to worry about program trading , but it 's only a piece of the business . ''
6888	The program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market , and even Europeans are suspicious .
6890	For now , however , Mr. Phelan said : `` I refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is hunky-dory .
6891	We have a major problem , and that problem is volatility . ''
6893	A NEW MINIMUM-WAGE PLAN has been worked out by Congress and Bush , opening the way for the first increase in over nine years .
6894	The compromise proposal , ending a long impasse between Democrats and the president , would boost the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 from $ 3.35 now .
6898	Great Northern Nekoosa reacted coolly to Georgia-Pacific 's takeover bid of $ 58 a share , or $ 3.19 billion , though the suitor said all terms are negotiable .
6902	The dollar and bond prices also closed higher .
6903	Leading indicators rose a slight 0.2 % in September , a further indication the economy is slowing but without any clear sign of whether a recession looms .
6907	Time Warner and Sony could end up becoming partners in several business ventures as part of a settlement of their dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters .

6924	Bond prices staggered in seesaw trading , rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength .
6926	`` We saw good buying in Japan and excellent buying in London , '' said Jay Goldinger , market strategist and trader at Capital Insight Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif .
6928	Late in London , the dollar was quoted at 1.8410 West German marks and 142.70 Japanese yen , up from late Monday in New York .
6931	The contraction was twice as large as economists projected and was the sharpest decline since a 19 % drop in January 1982 .
6938	The benchmark 30-year bond was nearly 1\/4 point higher , or up about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
6939	New two-year notes ended unchanged while three-year and four-year notes were slightly lower .
6946	IBM 's visits to the debt market are closely watched by treasurers at other corporations and by credit market analysts .
6949	The boost in rates sent IBM 's bonds tumbling , leaving underwriters with millions of dollars of losses and triggering a sell-off in the overall market .

6967	Since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market , at least two other junk issuers have said they plan to scale back planned high-yield offerings , and several issues have been postponed .
6973	By October , however , market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted to be offered at a yield of between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 % .
6988	`` We were oversold and today we bounced back .
6990	`` There were no -LCB- sell -RCB- lists and the calendar is lightening up a bit .
6999	West German bonds firmed a bit after Monday 's fall , but traders said the market remains bearish due to speculation that interest rates could rise again .
7000	In a speech given Friday but released late Monday , Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger suggested that it was risky to claim that the booming German economy has reached the peak of its cycle .
7002	On Oct. 5 , the Bundesbank raised the Lombard and discount rates by one percentage point to 8 % and 6 % , respectively , the highest levels in seven years .
7009	The two units are Prentice Hall Information Services , which publishes tax , financial planning and business law information , among other services , and Prentice Hall Information Network , which electronically delivers tax information .
7010	Terms were n't disclosed , but industry executives said the units were sold for $ 40 million .
7011	Arthur H. Rosenfeld , previously president of the Prentice Hall Tax and Professional Services division , was named president of the newly formed Macmillan Professional and Business Reference division .
7013	A governing body of both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board voted to give the FASB jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government-owned entities .
7014	The Financial Accounting Foundation voted 12-2 that FASB accounting rules supercede GASB rules in regard to utilities , hospitals , and colleges and universities owned by the government .
7017	The GASB had told governments they did n't have to follow FASB rules on depreciation , making it difficult for bond-rating agencies to compare private and state-owned schools , which compete in the public bond market .
7018	The foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next Jan. 1 and makes the financial results of the hospitals , colleges and schools easier to compare with for-profit businesses .
7019	But it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under FASB rules and those still under GASB rules .
7020	`` Managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and financial-report comparability with profit-making businesses is n't always as high a priority , '' a foundation spokesman said .
7024	After fees and repayment of debt , Avery is left with about $ 24 million in cash and securities from the Uniroyal sale .
7025	Avery paid $ 750 million , including various legal and financing fees , to acquire Uniroyal Chemical , Middlebury , Conn. , in 1986 -- a move that burdened Avery with debt .
7027	According to Avery , for the year ended Sept. 30 , 1988 , Uniroyal Chemical had sales of $ 734.2 million and a net loss of $ 47.1 million .
7028	An Avery spokesman said that the loss was magnified by accounting adjustments and that the company 's loss was smaller on a cash basis .
7029	Uniroyal has 2,600 employees and facilities in the U.S. , Canada , Brazil , Italy and Taiwan .
7030	In a related development , Avery said it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers , Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May , surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery 's common shares .
7032	In December 1988 , Messrs. Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc. , a packaging company they controlled , to Pechiney Corp. of France .
7034	In January 1989 , the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle , including a controlling stake in Avery and , by extension , Uniroyal Chemical .
7035	In the August proxy material , Avery said that unless it sold Uniroyal , its ability to service debt would be hurt and Avery 's shareholder value would `` continue to erode . ''
7036	Until Avery makes an acquisition , Messrs. Peltz and May will waive their direct salaries and bonuses , the company said .
7037	For at least the next six months , however , Avery will continue to pay $ 200,000 a month for management services to a company controlled by Messrs. Peltz and May , according to the proxy material .
7039	Clarcor , a maker of packaging and filtration products , said the two companies could n't agree on terms of a definitive agreement .
7040	The sale price of the unit , which makes packaging products , was to consist of cash , notes and an amount to be determined by the unit 's future performance .
7042	Both Clarcor and Anderson are based in Rockford , Ill .
7046	Earlier this month , a group led by three of the company 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and Willam E. Trotter II , indicated it had a 45.2 % stake in the Louisville , Ky. , fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board .
7051	Eight companies submitted bids , but Fujitsu won the contract by essentially saying it would do the job for free .
7052	News of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers .
7055	Hiroshima officials said they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans to cancel it .
7058	In a civil suit commenced in state Supreme Court in New York , the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have `` lowered every price on every item '' as part of an advertising campaign that began June 1 .
7059	The agency said it monitored Newmark & Lewis 's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign , and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same .
7060	In late May , Newmark & Lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5 % to 20 % and eliminate what it called a `` standard discount-retailing practice '' of negotiating individual deals with customers .
7063	Mr. Lewis said the company marked price tags and advertised at its `` lowest possible prices '' for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion .
7064	Mr. Lewis said the company gave the Consumer Affairs department `` volumes of documents '' to substantiate its statements , and made `` every effort to comply '' with all the agency 's policies .
7065	In its suit , the consumer agency seeks fines of $ 1,000 per violation of the city 's Consumer Protection Law , costs of investigation , and an injunction to prevent Newmark & Lewis from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising .
7066	Wary investors have been running for the stock market 's equivalent of bomb shelters , buying shares of gold-mining and utility companies .
7068	On Friday , when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange , five were gold-mining issues , and another four were utilities .
7069	On Monday , when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs , six were utilities or golds .
7070	At first glance , gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows .
7075	If the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on firmer footing , these stocks might well fall back .
7077	Still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares .
7081	Beyond that , money managers and analysts see other problems .
7082	Inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto makers are idling plants .
7085	`` The gyrations in the British government '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market , says John Hoffman , assistant director of research at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
7087	`` If the Fed does not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term interest rates over the next 30 days , the market 's going to flounder , '' says Larry Wachtel , a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities .
7089	Utilities are a classic example : Even in recessions , people continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate .
7090	Such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have been in favor for some time .
7092	Mr. Wachtel points to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples : They 're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings .
7096	If gold stocks and utilities continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times .
7101	One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows .
7104	Robert Stovall , a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall\/Twenty-First Securities , has money in both gold and utility issues .
7109	He favors FPL Group Inc. , Florida Progress Corp. , TECO Energy Inc. , Wisconsin Energy Corp. , and Dominion Resources Inc .
7113	His favorites are American Barrick Resources Corp. , Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp .
7117	Abby Cohen , an investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold .
7120	Among utilities , Drexel currently favors Entergy Corp. and General Public Utilities Corp .
7122	Among gold stocks , Drexel likes Battle Mountain Gold Co. , Newmont Gold Co. and Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co .
7123	It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems -LRB- `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone Policy ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 -RRB- .
7124	To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted .
7125	Consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure .
7126	Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish .
7128	Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago .
7130	This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group 's ploy to create a market .
7131	It 's time business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral , symbiotic player within nature 's workings .
7133	Mr. Melloan 's column was right on the money , but I wish it could have gone one step further .
7134	As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer , I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory -LRB- named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere -RRB- and the Montreal Protocol .
7136	In my research , I have found a paper by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute and several colleagues reporting an 11-year decrease in UV-B radiation at eight U.S. measurement sites .
7137	Our concern for the ozone layer , of course , grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation , which could damage flora and fauna .
7138	The last of the measurements reported was in 1985 , but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend .
7139	I understand , but have n't yet verified , that there are studies by Norwegians , Russians and the Max Planck Institute that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface .
7140	To me , this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort .
7142	My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission , the Environmental Protection Agency , Friends of the Earth , etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited .
7143	When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study , I was urged to get back to the agenda topic , which was , ironically , a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs , the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario .

7151	The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974 .
7153	The discovery of the ozone `` hole '' over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations .
7154	In the September issue of Scientific American , Thomas E. Graedel , distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories , and Paul J. Crutzen , director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , West Germany , wrote , `` It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons , particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion . ''
7155	Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement .
7156	However , unlike Messrs. Graedel and Crutzen , who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry , Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area .
7158	It is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists `` needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts '' and that environmental groups need them to stay in business .
7159	Solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry , policy makers and the scientific community world-wide .
7161	Nearly two months after saying it had been the victim of widespread fraud , MiniScribe Corp. disclosed it had a negative net worth of $ 88 million as of July 2 and hinted that it might be forced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws .
7162	Richard Rifenburgh , chairman and chief executive of the Longmont , Colo. , disk-drive maker , also said the company continued losing money in the third quarter and expects to sustain further losses through the end of the year .
7163	Mr. Rifenburgh told industry analysts he is moving `` aggressively '' to negotiate out-of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits , but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail .
7165	MiniScribe has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income .
7172	Analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday 's announcements , praising Mr. Rifenburgh 's efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace .
7174	Others pointed out that at least four other disk-drive makers will have competitive one-inch drives early next year and that the industry already operates on very thin margins .
7177	MiniScribe filed a status report with the NASD on Monday , detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception , but has n't received a response .
7178	MiniScribe common closed yesterday at $ 1.9375 , down 6.25 cents , and has been trading for several months at less than $ 3 a share .
7180	The MiniScribe report outlines a host of allegedly fraudulent practices , including the shipment of bricks and defective disk drives that were booked as sales , and inventory forgeries in accounting records .
7183	He added that he expects to make a recommendation within a few weeks on whether MiniScribe should file its own lawsuits against former company officers and directors .
7184	American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein in the Oct. 21 TV Guide on `` What TV News Does n't Report About Congress -- and Should '' :
7185	By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise , Wright and Tower , the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution ... .
7186	An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in , say , West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not .
7189	The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal , sensitive and intimate facts .
7190	Traditional standards of relevancy and importance -LRB- `` is this something the public ought to know '' -RRB- will be replaced by a much broader test -LRB- `` is this something the public is interested in knowing '' -RRB- .
7191	And , since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism , reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships , activities of family members , and all matters about mental and physical health .
7192	Similarly , visual images will be more vivid , sensational and , sometimes , gruesome .
7198	Over the past two years , the Fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms .
7199	Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
7203	Private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of $ 1 million , that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
7204	Last year , Bankers Trust said it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .
7206	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
7207	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
7210	Bonnie J. Stedt was named an executive vice president of the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit of this travel and financial services firm .
7212	Joe F. Lynch , the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of First Continental Real Estate Investment Trust , was named to the new post of vice chairman of this bank holding company .
7213	Every workday at 11 a.m. , 40-year-old Mike Sinyard dons cycling clothes , hops on a bike he keeps at his Morgan Hill , Calif. , office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car .
7217	Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen , Specialized spotted the appeal of fat-tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in 1981 .
7223	One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create , turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as Schwinn , Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki .
7228	`` The big word around Specialized is passion , '' says Erik Eidsmo , a former ski-industry executive whom Mr. Sinyard recruited from Citicorp to run marketing and sales .
7236	Since his arrival in May , Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp , such as management-by-objective , detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends .
7243	At the trade show , Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three-spoked bike wheel developed jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co .
7245	It currently costs $ 750 , though Mr. Sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ 200 and $ 250 .
7256	Trek previously made only traditional road bikes , but `` it did n't take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike , '' says Trek 's president , Dick Burke .
7260	Schwinn Bicycle Co. , Chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary to sell bikes .
7261	In the past year , Derby International Corp. , Luxembourg , has acquired such major brands as Peugeot , Raleigh and Nishiki .
7263	The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales .
7266	Robert C. Snyder , a director and chief operating officer of the company , succeeds Mr. Pfeiffer as president .
7268	Michael Ruettgers , who had been executive vice president , operations , was named president and chief operating officer .

7272	John Franco , 47 years old , formerly vice chairman of Capital Holding Corp. and president of its Accumulation Investment Group , was named chief executive officer of this insurance holding company , effective Dec. 1 , succeeding Robert T. Shaw , who remains chairman .
7274	MCI Communications Corp. said it won a $ 27 million contract from Stuart-James Co. , a Denver investment banking concern , to provide voice and data telecommunications services .
7275	The agreement calls for MCI to provide data service , 800 and Vnet service , a virtual private network service .
7284	Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's biggest investor , would like to withdraw from the satellite-TV consortium , and analysts have speculated Hollywood studios might buy the Bond stake .
7286	Besides Bond Corp. , British Satellite 's other backers include Pearson PLC , Reed International PLC and Granada Group PLC .
7290	The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers .
7291	British Satellite today is unveiling a # 30 million advertising and promotional drive for the consortium 's planned five channels of movies , sports , entertainment and news shows .
7292	As part of the drive , the first 50,000 viewers who put up # 10 each will get a package valued at # 170 -- including a satellite receiving dish , equipment installation and a three-month subscription to its pay-movie service .
7293	British Satellite faces competition from Sky Television , a satellite-TV venture begun last February and owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
7303	Dealers said the market was supported to some extent by a firmer pound , gains on Wall Street and shopping by market-makers to cover internal requirements for selected stocks in the 100-share index .
7309	In London trading , Courtaulds , a chemicals and textiles company , increased 15 pence to 362 after it disclosed plans to spin off its textiles operations into a separately listed company on Jan. 1 .
7322	Investors , who took profits Friday , mostly took a wait-and-see attitude Monday amid uncertainty in the foreign-currency market and New York stocks , traders said .
7325	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section , which fell 15.82 points Friday , was down 5.16 points , or 0.19 % , at 2676.60 .
7326	The Second Section index , which fell 36.87 points Friday , was down 21.44 points , or 0.59 % , to close at 3636.06 .
7328	Monday 's losers included railway , electric-utility and high-technology issues .
7337	Share prices in Frankfurt closed narrowly mixed after listless and directionless trading .
7341	Another factor weighing on the Frankfurt market involves fears about the impending wage talks between the IG Metall metal-workers union and industry representatives , which could result in a wave of strikes next spring , traders said .
7343	Elsewhere , stock prices were lower in Brussels , Milan and Stockholm , and mixed in Amsterdam , Paris and Zurich .
7344	Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong , Manila , Seoul , Sydney , Taipei and Wellington , but were lower in Singapore .
7349	The maker of farm equipment said the three-year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at John Deere Horicon Works , Deere 's primary facility for producing lawn and grounds-care equipment , takes effect immediately and extends through Oct. 1 , 1992 .
7352	The British chemical and textile company 's plan , which requires shareholder approval , would create a new , listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million -LRB- $ 473 million -RRB- and # 400 million , analysts said .
7360	In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .
7363	Even without a specific takeover threat , Courtaulds is giving shareholders `` choice and value , '' said Julia Blake , an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
7364	In a statement , the company said : `` Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies .
7365	The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees . ''
7366	Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .
7375	Officials at the Japanese semiconductor maker said the company intends to increase investment in plant and equipment by 10 billion yen -LRB- $ 70.6 million -RRB- , to 90 billion yen , in the year ending March 31 , with the extra funds used to increase production overseas .
7376	Officials said they were n't sure how the money will be distributed among overseas units , but added that NEC Semiconductors U.K. Ltd. will receive priority .
7378	Japan 's steel exports fell 12.2 % in September from a year earlier and were down 1.1 % from the previous month , the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported .
7381	Japanese steel companies are apparently focusing on domestic sales , but the official said it does n't necessarily mean that local sales contracts are increasing that markedly .
7382	`` They are just too busy to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments , '' the official said .
7386	During the first hour of trading yesterday , prices fell as much as 1\/4 point , or down about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
7389	`` We saw good retail demand by small banks , individuals and institutions and that is one reason why the market advanced '' late in the day , said Sung Won Sohn , senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis .
7392	Other key economic indicators due this week include today 's release of the September leading indicators index and new-home sales .
7393	Tomorrow , the October purchasing managers report is due and on Thursday comes October chain-store sales .
7395	Although the Treasury will announce details of the November refunding tomorrow , it could be delayed if Congress and President Bush fail to increase the Treasury 's borrowing capacity .
7398	Mortgage-backed securities were up less than 1\/8 point and investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged .
7406	A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainties .
7407	New York bonds , which have been hammered in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city 's economy is growing weaker , rose 1\/2 point yesterday .
7413	The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.78 % and the rate on six-month bills was 7.62 % .
7414	Those rates are up from 7.52 % and 7.50 % , respectively , at last week 's auction .
7417	And because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity .
7421	Here are details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction :
7422	Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
7426	The 13-week bills mature Feb. 1 , and the 26-week bills mature May 3 , 1990 .
7429	The bills are dated Oct. 31 and mature Dec. 21 , 1989 .
7435	Yesterday , Western Union 's senior secured reset notes fell 3 3\/4 points , or about $ 37.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to close at 50 1\/4 .
7437	The company 's 7.90 % sinking fund debentures were quoted at a bid price of 14 1\/4 and an offered price of 30 , while the 10 3\/4 % subordinated debentures of 1997 were being bid for at 28 and offered at around 34 3\/4 .
7439	High-yield traders said spreads between the bid and offered prices of Western Union junk bonds have been widening for some time , and in certain cases , bids for Western Union securities are not available .
7440	Elsewhere , prices of investment-grade and high-risk , high-yield junk bonds ended unchanged .
7442	The two-part issue consists of $ 200 million of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in 1997 and $ 150 million of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in 1997 .
7443	Portfolio managers said expectations are for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of 13 3\/4 % and a yield of about 14 % .
7444	The Chicago-based food and consumer goods concern was acquired in April 1986 in a $ 6.2 billion leveraged buy-out engineered by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co .
7450	Ginnie Mae 's 9 % issue for November delivery finished at 98 1\/2 , up 4\/32 , and its 10 % issue at 102 3\/8 , up 4\/32 .
7452	In the derivative market , insurance companies have scaled back their purchases of Remic securities , or real estate mortgage investment conduits , as they assess potential claims from the recent California earthquake and hurricane in the Carolinas .
7455	The PACs appeal to insurance companies and other investors because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , quasi-federal agencies .
7458	Both the MNC and Beneficial offering were underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , the leading Wall Street firm in the home-equity securities market , which was created early this year .
7460	The improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the New York City sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and Tbond futures continued to grow more negative .
7461	The MOB spread , or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand .
7465	British government bonds ended moderately higher , encouraged by a steadier pound and a rise in British stocks .
7476	He explained , in part , that restructuring to prepare for the Common Market expansion due in 1992 `` has become more of a strategic priority , both for companies inside and outside the European Community . ''
7477	In the second quarter , middle-market cross-border transactions -- deals under $ 100 million each -- numbered 619 and totaled $ 6 billion , compared with 478 such transactions totaling $ 4.9 billion a year earlier , the firm said .
7478	Large cross-border deals numbered 51 and totaled $ 17.1 billion in the second quarter , the firm added .
7481	The food company , which has 720,000 warrants and about 2.9 million common shares outstanding , said it may increase the offer to purchase any or all warrants that are properly tendered .
7483	The warrants expire on Oct. 15 , 1992 , and may be called by the company at a price of $ 5.25 .
7495	Gen-Probe Inc. , a biotechnology concern , said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo for about $ 110 million , or almost double the market price of Gen-Probe 's stock .
7497	It is also likely to bolster fears that the Japanese will use their foothold in U.S. biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages .
7498	Gen-Probe , an industry leader in the field of genetic probes , which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests , last year signed an agreement for Chugai to exclusively market its diagnostic products in Japan for infectious diseases and cancer .
7499	Chugai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs .
7500	That arrangement apparently has worked well , and Thomas A. Bologna , president and chief executive officer of Gen-Probe , founded in 1983 , said the sale of the company means `` we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing . ''
7503	Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition .
7508	Chugai has been one of the most active Japanese players in U.S. biotechnology companies ; it has an equity investment in Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , and a joint-venture agreement with Upjohn Co. , Kalamazoo , Mich .
7510	`` It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the U.S. and Japan , '' he said , adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor , electronics , and automobile industries , Japanese companies will use U.S.-developed technology to gain trade advantages .
7511	Mr. Bologna said the sale would allow Gen-Probe to speed up the development of new technology , and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer .
7512	By 1988 , when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration , eight of them had been developed and sold by Gen-Probe .
7513	Osamu Nagayama , deputy president of Chugai , which spends about 15 % of its sales on research and development , was unable to pinpoint how much money Chugai would pump into Gen-Probe .
7515	He and Mr. Bologna emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of Gen-Probe , which will expand `` significantly '' as a result of the acquisition .
7518	Recently , Gen-Probe received a broad U.S. patent for a technology that helps detect , identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called ribosomal RNA .
7519	Among other things , Mr. Bologna said that the sale will facilitate Gen-Probe 's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome , or AIDS .
7520	Chugai also will help Gen-Probe with its regulatory and marketing expertise in Asia , Mr. Bologna said .
7527	The visitors then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware .
7534	Japan-U.S. trade relations are bumpy these days , and some Japanese favor decreasing their reliance on U.S. technology in light of the FSX fighter-plane flap , when U.S. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology .
7536	It 's a world leader in semiconductors , but behind the U.S. in making the computers that use those chips .
7537	It 's a world leader in auto manufacturing , but its aviation industry is struggling , and its space program is years behind the U.S. , the Europeans and the Soviets .
7539	Many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions , videocassette recorders , small tractors and food-processing machinery .
7543	Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system .
7544	Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets .
7547	`` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union , '' says a State Department official .
7550	They believe technology is one of their best bets , and some Soviet officials say Moscow will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right .
7551	The Soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in New York and West Germany .
7554	In August , representatives of Keidanren , Japan 's largest business organization , visited Moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy .
7556	These mainly involved such areas as materials -- advanced soldering machines , for example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space , such as artificial blood vessels .
7559	`` The Soviet Union has a lot of know-how , but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy , '' says Mr. Shapovalov , the Foreign Ministry official .
7560	The Soviets are `` contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop -LCB- technology -RCB- jointly and even to market it jointly , '' he says .
7564	So far , the Soviets have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans .
7566	`` My impression is that there is n't anything which arouses our interest at first glance , '' says an official from Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry .
7570	It scared brokers , but most survived .
7571	It took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and traders and exchanges .
7574	Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades .
7575	And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , women and junkets .
7577	Ray Garrett Jr. , SEC chairman , said the `` breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected . ''
7580	The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms .
7584	It came in London 's `` Big Bang '' 1986 deregulation ; and Toronto 's `` Little Bang '' the same year .
7587	Mr. Bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission , composed of top government aides and business and labor leaders .
7589	In remarks at a White House ceremony marking Polish Heritage Month , Mr. Bush announced that Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter , Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole will lead the U.S. group .
7591	In addition , the White House said that Charles Harper , chairman of ConAgra Inc. , and John McGillicuddy , chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. , will be among a group of at least 15 business and labor representatives in the presidential mission .
7592	Mr. Bush said the group is to `` focus on economic sectors where U.S. expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference . ''
7593	Mr. Bush has asked Congress to provide more than $ 400 million in economic aid and food grants for Poland 's new government , but has been chided by Democrats for failing to do more .
7594	Warner Communications Inc. is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with Irving Azoff , who resigned in September as head of MCA Inc. 's MCA Records unit .
7595	Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment , as did MCA , where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture .
7596	But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff .
7598	The agreement is said to be similar to Warner 's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen , whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit .
7600	Like Mr. Geffen 's arrangement , the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world 's largest and most successful record distributor ; in the U.S. alone , Warner has a 40 % share of the market , about double its nearest competitor , Sony Corp. 's CBS Records .
7604	Mr. Azoff reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top MCA management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans .
7609	`` I ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he says , making it too painful to row .
7612	A San Francisco lawyer , Mr. Panelli rowed religiously when he first got the machine , but , he complains , it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring .
7620	Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics .
7623	The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers .
7624	The survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships , tennis rackets and home exercise equipment , but people 's good intentions , if not their actions , are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy .
7625	For instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8 % to about $ 1.52 billion this year , according to the National Sporting Goods Association , which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s .
7629	With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years , he adds , `` a lot of garages , basements and attics must be populated with them . ''
7634	On a video screen , riders can see 30 different `` rides , '' including urban , mountain and desert scenes , and check how many calories are burned a minute .
7637	But rather than write off home fitness equipment , she traded up : Ms. Igdaloff just paid about $ 900 for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair .
7639	`` I spent so much money that if I look at it , and I 'm not on it , I feel guilty . ''
7640	The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do .
7642	This conjures up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests couch potatoes are out of season .
7646	`` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year , '' says Krys Spain , research specialist for the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports .
7649	While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of Americans who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is only 10 % to 20 % .
7650	So many people fudge on answers about exercise , the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve 60 % of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes .
7654	Of 14 activities , the Journal survey found that 12 -- including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer Americans today than eight years ago .
7655	Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline .
7656	Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only slightly .
7657	Jeanette Traverso , a California lawyer , gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf , finding it more social and serene .
7658	It 's an activity she feels she can do for life , and by pulling a golf cart , she still gets a good workout .
7660	Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment .

7681	The American Bowling Congress claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes its membership has declined this decade .

7703	If there 's something ' weird and it do n't look good .
7705	For starters , some people call Ed and Lorraine Warren .
7707	They claim to have busted spirits , poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country .
7708	They say they now get three or four `` legitimate '' calls a week from people harried by haunts .
7709	`` I firmly believe in angels , devils and ghosts , '' says Mr. Warren , whose business card identifies him as a `` demonologist . ''
7710	If psychics do n't work , but your house still seems haunted , you can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such as Richard Busch .
7711	A professional magician and musician , he heads the Pittsburgh branch of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal .
7712	Mr. Busch says there is a scientific explanation for all haunts , and he can even tell you how to encourage the spirits .
7713	`` All you have to do is eat a big pizza , and then go to bed , '' he says .
7716	Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation 's Elm Streets and Amityvilles .
7718	In a public opinion poll published in the October issue of Parents Magazine , a third of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people .
7721	The spirits , of course , could hardly care less whether people do or do n't believe in them .
7726	Mr. Baker heads the Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics .
7728	But they do n't careen around in an old Cadillac , wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits .
7729	Mr. Baker drives a 1987 Chevy and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays .
7735	`` People see activity in there , and the next thing you know , you 've got a haunting , '' he says .
7736	On a recent afternoon , Mr. Baker and a reporter go ghost-busting , visiting Kathleen Stinnett , a Lexington woman who has phoned the University of Kentucky to report mysterious happenings in her house .
7737	Mrs. Stinnett says she never believed in ghosts before , but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on , a telephone flew off its stand , doors slammed inexplicably , and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen .
7738	`` I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who was there , and it was nobody , '' she says , eyes wide at the recollection .
7739	Mr. Baker hears her out , pokes around a bit , asks a few questions and proposes some explanations .
7741	The flying telephone : `` You tangle the base cord around a chair leg , and the receiver does seem to fly off . ''
7742	The ghostly footsteps : `` Interstate 64 is a block away , and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating . ''
7748	`` I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave .
7749	It 's reassuring , and it usually works . ''
7750	Oregon 's Mr. Hyman has investigated claims of flying cats , apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation , he says , for every one .
7755	He showed up with a carpenter 's level , carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused by the perspective .
7756	`` A very striking illusion , '' Mr. Hyman says now , his voice dripping with skepticism , `` but an illusion nevertheless . ''
7758	The Rev. Alphonsus Trabold , a theology professor and exorcism expert at St. Bonaventure University in Olean , N.Y. , frequently is asked to exorcise unruly spirits , and he often obliges .
7759	`` On certain occasions a spirit could be earthbound and make itself known , '' he says .
7761	Father Trabold often uses what he calls `` a therapeutic exorcism '' : a few prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave .
7766	I attend , and so does a television crew from New York City .
7768	A Scottish dwarf built the small red house 110 years ago and now his demonic ghost haunts it , Mr. Warren says .
7769	The owner , who begs anonymity , asserts that the dwarf , appearing as a dark shadow , has manhandled her , tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair .
7773	Suddenly the woman begins swaying and then writhing .
7774	`` She 's being attacked by the demon , '' Mrs. Warren stagewhispers as the priest sprinkles holy water over the squirming woman , and the television camera grinds .
7775	A half-hour later , the woman is smiling and chatting ; the demon seems to have gone .

7804	In recent months , California 's Transportation Department has been recruiting in Pennsylvania , Arizona and Texas for engineers experienced in road and bridge design .
7805	But , with the state offering only $ 39,000 a year and California 's high standard of living , `` there are n't too many to choose from , '' says Brent Scott , a recruiting officer .
7806	He says the department now has 75 openings and wants to hire 625 civil engineers over the next 15 months .
7809	Employee-benefit specialists drew a collective sigh of relief in early October when the Labor Department backed away from a proposal that companies let former employees and beneficiaries -- along with active workers -- borrow against balances in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and similar savings plans .
7810	In an advisory letter , the department said that , starting Oct. 18 , loans could be limited to `` parties in interest , '' which generally means active workers but also includes retirees who continue as directors and 10 % shareholders .
7811	Now comes word that IRS regulations being drafted could put companies in violation of the tax code if they make loans to retiree shareholders and directors but do n't make them available to other former workers who usually earned less .
7813	But violation could bring substantial tax penalties to both employer and employees .
7818	Both reflect the dismissal of lower-level and shorter-tenure executives .

7841	Democracy is making a return with a vengeance to Latin America 's most populous and deeply indebted country .
7843	The candidates have been crisscrossing this huge country of 145 million people , holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must be one of the world 's most thankless political jobs : trying to drag Brazil out of its economic and social mess .
7849	He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls , probably less because of his vague program to `` build a new Brazil '' than because of his good looks , the open backing of the powerful Rede Globo television network and his reputation as a hunter of `` maharajahs , '' or overpaid and underworked civil servants .
7852	Two left-wing politicians , Socialist Leonel Brizola , a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state , and Marxist-leaning Luis Inacio da Silva , currently are running neck and neck at about 15 % , and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the Dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote-getters : Social Democrat Mario Covas and two conservatives , Paulo Salim Maluf , a former governor of the state of Sao Paulo , and Guilherme Afif Domingos .
7856	The big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil 's economic ills .
7859	What comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in determining whether Brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world 's eighth largest economy or keeps living up to its other , less enviable title : that of the developing world 's largest debtor , teetering on the brink of hyperinflation , mired in deficits and stagnation , with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface .
7860	If Brazil devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt , this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy , analysts say , just as Argentinian President Carlos Saul Menem has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform .
7861	`` Depending on the president , we could either be a trillion-dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are , '' says political scientist Amaury de Souza .
7863	Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year .
7864	That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the rate down sharply in August and September .
7865	Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 % a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper .
7866	About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .
7867	By some estimates , Brazil 's internal debt , or combined public deficit , could reach 6.5 % of its $ 351 billion gross domestic product .
7868	Much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating .
7870	It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number .
7872	Economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending ; focusing spending on vital areas such as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado .
7878	The 67-year-old Mr. Brizola has been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric , but analysts say he probably would be pragmatic .
7879	Mr. da Silva , a 43-year-old former factory worker and labor leader , is the most radical , vowing to withhold payments on the foreign debt and saying he `` would n't go around putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder . ''
7882	WHICH IS the best medicine for runaway health costs : competition or regulation ?
7883	The question is at the root of a brawl between Humana Inc. , the big for-profit hospital and insurance company , and its not-for-profit brethren in its home state of Kentucky .
7886	But according to David Jones , Humana 's chief executive , it promotes technology monopolies , stifles innovation and raises prices .
7892	The Humana hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue , Mr. Conn says , and now charges as much as $ 8,000 for the procedure , which costs only about $ 3,500 in Lexington .
7893	Humana contends that $ 8,000 represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is $ 4,900 .
7899	And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice .
7900	`` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan -LRB- to start a practice -RRB- , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .
7906	It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests , says John H. Moxley III , who directs physician-executive searches for Korn\/Ferry International .
7912	The 12-bed `` cooperative care '' unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital .
7913	`` The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care , '' says Anthony J. Grieco , medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center , where the concept began 10 years ago .
7914	`` It helps us , and them , while they 're here , and it certainly makes them a better health-care team when they get home . ''
7916	Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff , room charges are lower -- about $ 100 less per day than a regular room at the Vermont hospital .
7917	Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy , diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels , and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative-care units .
7920	Odds and Ends
7921	THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for more than 1,000 employees and at least one-third of a hospital 's budget ; a head nurse typically oversees up to 80 employees and $ 8 million .

7924	A group of Michigan investors has offered to buy Knight-Ridder Inc. 's ailing Detroit Free Press for $ 68 million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed .
7926	The group led by Birmingham , Mich. , publicist William D. McMaster did n't name an investment banker backing the deal or say how much its members will contribute to the offer .
7927	Indeed , some individuals identified with the group said they have n't committed any money to the bid and were n't aware of it until they heard about it in local news accounts over the weekend .
7929	The company has said the paper is n't for sale , and has rebuffed Mr. McMaster 's earlier requests for access to Free Press financial statements .
7930	In his letter to Knight-Ridder President James K. Batten , Mr. McMaster said he arrived at the $ 68 million figure using Knight-Ridder 's corporate financial statements and comments by Knight-Ridder officials that the Free Press has a $ 50 million value in salvage .
7931	But in an interview , Mr. McMaster said he and his investment banker would need access to full financial records before firming up the offer .

7936	NRM Energy Co. said it filed materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited partnership .
7938	NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September .
7939	However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital , NRM said .
7940	In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change .
7943	After the transaction , current common unitholders will own about 21.3 % of Edisto , current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3 % , and current stockholders of Edisto will own about 6.4 % , about the same stake as Edisto owns now in NRM .
7946	As part of the transaction , Edisto agreed to give Mesa , an Amarillo , Texas , oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr. , a seat on its board .
7950	Sherwin-Williams Co. and Whittaker Corp. said they 've discontinued talks toward a definitive agreement regarding Sherwin-Williams ' acquisition of Whittaker 's chemical coating group .

7957	The recently revived enthusiasm among small investors for stock mutual funds has been damped by a jittery stock market and the tumult over program trading .
7961	`` Now everything '' -- such as program trading and wide stock market swings -- `` that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there . ''
7976	`` Small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios '' stemming from falling prices , said Jacob Dreyer , the institute 's chief economist .
7978	Assets of these and other short-term funds surged more than $ 5 billion in September , the institute said .
7982	But he emphasized that new accounts , new sales , inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from September 's level .
7990	These managers held 9.8 % of assets in cash at the end of September , down from 10.2 % in August and 10.6 % in September 1988 .
7991	Large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets .
7997	`` There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds , at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds , '' says Avi Nachmany , an analyst at Strategic Insight , a New York fund-research concern .
7998	Secretary of State Baker , we read , decided to kill a speech that Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert , was going to give to a student colloquium , the National Collegiate Security Conference .
8000	Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev 's need for `` a stable currency , free and competitive markets , private property and real prices '' and other pie-in-the-sky reforms .
8001	Perhaps he 'd have called for `` a decentralized political and economic system '' without a dominant communist party .
8002	Or political arrangements `` to alleviate the grievances and demands of Soviet ethnic minorities and republics . ''
8004	If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things , we would now be hearing about `` discord '' and `` disarray '' on foreign policy .
8008	So far as we can see , there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker , Mr. Quayle , the Mr. Gates we 've read , or for that matter President Bush .
8013	GATT membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap , nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists .
8016	We do n't expect much good from nuclear-arms control , but conventional-arms talks might demilitarize Eastern Europe .
8017	There 's nothing in the least contradictory in all this , and it would be nice to think that Washington could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated , complex view .
8019	So every time a Bush official raises a doubt about Mr. Gorbachev , the Washington community shouts `` Cold War '' and `` timidity , '' and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out to reply , `` Mr. Bush wants perestroika to succeed . ''
8021	Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate , clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism , and fainting spells when someone writes the word `` controversy . ''
8022	As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times : `` Baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press . ''
8023	In short , the problem is not intra-administration disagreement , but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail , and its political opponents will ask `` Who lost Gorbachev ? ''
8024	Mr. Baker may want to avoid criticism from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World , not just Congress .
8031	Even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret , these are not very complicated thoughts .
8032	Surely there is someone in the administration , maybe Bob Gates , who could explain them to college students , or even schoolchildren .
8034	Mr. Jordan has served as executive director of the United Negro College Fund , director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council and attorney-consultant to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity .
8037	Seats are currently quoted at $ 151,000 , bid , and $ 162,000 , asked .
8038	Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant , ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads .
8040	Describing this and other grisly killings , Sen. Strom Thurmond -LRB- R. , S.C . -RRB- recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty .
8042	There 's just one problem : The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings .
8049	In 1972 , the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional .
8051	For instance , juries would have to consider specific `` aggravating '' and `` mitigating '' factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death .
8055	Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage .
8060	Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death .
8064	`` It 's distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make DEA , FBI and Customs work together '' on drug enforcement .
8065	Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill , but they contend that is n't the point .
8072	A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion .
8073	And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways .
8079	At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants .
8080	Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence .
8082	Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals , says Richard Burr , director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 's capital-punishment defense team .
8083	Mr. Kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year 's anti-drug legislation , and it will be severely attacked on the Senate floor this time around .
8085	It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims , perhaps .
8089	Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware 's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here , but he made no comment and asked no questions .
8091	Dow Jones has offered to pay $ 18 a share , or about $ 576 million , for the remaining Telerate stake .
8093	Robert Kornreich , an attorney for the Telerate holders , told Judge Hartnett the Dow Jones offer is `` arrogant '' and `` hostile . ''
8098	Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .
8099	Japan 's exports of cars , trucks and buses declined 2.4 % to 535,322 units in September from a year earlier , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said .
8104	Lone Star Technologies said it and its subsidiary 's creditors agree that the parent company owes the unit money , but they have n't been able to reach agreement on the amount .
8105	Judith Elkin , lawyer for the creditors , said the creditors group is challenging certain accounting entries on the parent company 's books and estimates that the receivable owed the steel company could be as much as $ 40 million .
8106	The Lone Star Steel lawsuit also asks the court to rule that Lone Star Technologies is jointly responsible for a $ 4.5 million Lone Star Steel pension payment that was due , but was n't paid , in September and that the parent company ca n't recover the amount from its subsidiary if the parent company makes the payment .
8109	Under Chapter 11 , a company continues to operate , but is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debt .
8116	`` The judge came out and said , ` Quick , let 's put this on the record , ' '' says Sandy Bettencourt , the judge 's court reporter .
8120	Lights flickered on and off ; plaster dropped from the ceiling , the walls still shook and an evacuation alarm blared outside .
8123	At stake was an $ 80,000 settlement involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas station , where underground fuel tanks had leaked and contaminated the soil .
8129	For the record , Jeffrey Kaufman , an attorney for Fireman 's Fund , said he was `` rattled -- both literally and figuratively . ''
8132	`` I did n't know if it was World War III or what , '' says Melanie Carvain of Morristown , N.J .

8154	In an interview with the trade journal Automotive News , Mr. Iacocca declined to say which plants will close or when Chrysler will make the moves .
8156	So the older or most inefficient capacity has got to go . ''
8157	According to industry analysts , Chrysler plants most likely to close are the St. Louis No. 1 facility , which builds Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models ; the Toledo , Ohio , Jeep plant , which dates back to the early 1900s ; and two Canadian plants that build the Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler 's full-sized vans .
8158	Chrysler has had to temporarily close the St. Louis and Toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there .
8161	General Motors Corp. has signaled that as many as five of its U.S. and Canadian plants may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity .
8162	The overcapacity problem has intensified in recent years , with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the U.S. .
8163	With companies such as Honda Motor Co. , Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. running so-called transplant auto operations , Japanese auto production in the U.S. will reach one million vehicles this year .
8165	The Japanese-managed plants eventually will have the capacity to build some 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. and that will translate into `` market share that is going to have to come out of somebody , '' he added .
8173	Also under Chapter 11 , a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders , banks and other creditors .
8175	He said he feared a Revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the Bass group 's offer would give them more money .
8176	However , the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- $ 260.5 million -- and no equity .
8178	Revco received the offer Oct. 20 , but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders .
8182	Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red .
8184	In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs .
8187	The company , based in Twinsburg , Ohio , said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51 % , to $ 9.2 million from $ 6.1 million .
8188	Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined to comment .
8189	The partnership also includes American Express Co. , Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
8190	The offer consists of $ 410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes .
8191	Acadia would sell up to 10 % of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares .
8192	Revco 's chairman and chief executive officer , Boake A. Sells , said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer .
8194	Any reorganization proposal , Mr. Sells said , is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company , bondholders , banks and other creditors .
8197	We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy Revco . ''
8205	Futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week , and the losses , individually and cumulatively , were greater than the advances .
8206	Two of the major factors buoying prices , the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico , were finally resolved .
8207	Also , the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected , and acted as a price depressant , analysts said .
8215	Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea .
8217	But as Highland Valley and Cananea begin operating , they are expected to resume their roles as Japan 's suppliers .
8218	According to Fred Demler , metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , New York , `` Highland Valley has already started operating and Cananea is expected to do so soon . ''
8222	However , traders disregarded a potential production disruption in Chile and a continued drop in inventories .
8223	Workers at two Chilean mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputado group , will vote Thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today .
8231	Consumer stocks of copper in the U.S. fell to 44,000 tons at the end of September from 54,000 tons a month earlier , and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons , down from 125,000 tons in June .
8234	GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
8235	The prices of most corn , soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought .
8236	Buying by the Soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks , but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums .
8240	According to one analyst , prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia , at the Pan-American summit meeting in Costa Rica , had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement .
8241	The reports , attributed to the Colombian minister of economic development , said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags , the analyst said .
8243	The Colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President Bush sent to Colombian President Virgilio Barco , and in which President Bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement .
8251	Last week 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety , he said , but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli .
8253	The dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling , as well , according to the analyst .
8254	Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its common shares for employee stock plans and other general corporate purposes .
8257	When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later , some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy .
8258	Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed .
8259	If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest .
8260	These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding .
8261	Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika .
8264	And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ?
8265	An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market .
8267	Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet -LRB- council -RRB- .
8268	Permission is far from automatic : The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
8269	Private dressmaking , for example , is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five ; shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine .
8271	But that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy , and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state .
8272	All independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising , but so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles .
8273	Medical cooperatives , among the most successful in the U.S.S.R. , are banned from providing general-practitioner services -LRB- their main source of income -RRB- , carrying out surgery , and treating cancer patients , drug addicts and pregnant women .
8274	Earlier this month , the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives : The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold ; the second bans cooperatives from buying `` industrial and food goods '' from the state or other cooperatives .
8276	Along with some other revealing indicators , these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls , he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought .
8278	He told the Congress of People 's Deputies on May 30 : `` We do not share this approach , since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country . ''
8279	Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons , and the market for fear of the social -LRB- political -RRB- consequences , Mr. Gorbachev seeks a `` third way '' that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter .
8280	Most important , this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed .
8281	Indeed , Mr. Gorbachev 's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism , whose architects spoke specifically of a `` third way '' : of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism .
8282	They , too , promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline .
8284	`` Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo -- corporation-socialist in form , nationalistic in content and Oriental in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness ... . ''
8285	The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an `` organic '' society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified , and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation .
8286	This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and `` harmonic '' society .
8288	By contrast , a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause , rather than resolve , conflict .
8290	In doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market .
8291	Instead , he proposed a `` law-governed economy , '' in which there would be a `` clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management . ''
8292	The latter would be undertaken by `` enterprises , joint stock companies and cooperatives . ''
8293	These would not function independently , but would act together to form `` combines , unions and associations '' to tackle problems and coordinate their activities .
8294	Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini , who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat .
8295	The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it .
8296	To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition .
8299	It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor .
8301	Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force , guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business , for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards -LRB- under the new resolutions , workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced -RRB- .
8302	By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher , and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods , Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party .
8305	An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims .
8307	Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task , however , as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor , capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo .
8308	If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system , he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition , and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe .
8309	The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations -- Mr. Gorbachev is a consummate political leader , perhaps one of the greatest -- but in its economic prescription .
8310	Contrary to widespread belief , Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time ; it is doubtful whether Soviet-style corporatism will make Soviet trains run on time , or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave .
8312	New construction contracting climbed 8 % in September to an annualized $ 274.2 billion , with commercial , industrial and public-works contracts providing most of the increase , according to F.W. Dodge Group .
8315	The Northeast and West regions were unchanged .
8316	A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing does n't increase in response to this year 's lower mortgage rates , said George A. Christie , vice president and chief economist of Dodge , the forecasting division of publisher McGraw-Hill Inc .
8321	Housing has been weak all year and especially so in the past five months .
8323	Commercial and industrial construction rose sharply , partly because of three large projects , each expected to cost more than $ 100 million .
8324	Institutional building , such as hospitals and schools , eased in September following a surge in August .
8326	Public-works and utility projects , also known as non-building contracting , grew 18 % to $ 52.2 billion in September , but the nine-month total of $ 36.9 billion was down 3 % from a year earlier .
8327	The Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors to get any behind-schedule road and bridge construction under way `` before the clock ran out , '' Mr. Christie said , referring to threatened 5 % across-the-board budget cuts .
8330	In downgrading CS First Boston 's subordinated domestic , Euromarket and Swiss debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2 , Moody 's is matching a move made by the other major credit rating concern , Standard & Poor 's Corp. , several months ago .
8331	Moody 's also confirmed the Prime-1 rating , its highest , on CS First Boston 's commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs .
8332	In addition , Moody 's said it downgraded Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston 's senior and subordinated Swiss debt to single-A-2 from single-A-1 and lowered Financiere CSFB N.V. 's junior subordinated perpetual Eurodebt , guaranteed by Financiere Credit Suisse -- First Boston , to single-A-3 from single-A-2 .
8335	We think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected .
8337	First Boston 's merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled .
8341	It said CS First Boston `` has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking '' and that `` a very significant portion '' of the firm 's profit in recent years has come from merchant banking-related business .
8342	`` Moody 's believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on CS First Boston 's performance , '' the rating concern said , citing `` continued problems '' from the firm 's exposures to `` various Campeau-related firms '' and to Ohio Mattress .
8346	`` This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line '' with revenue , said J. David Hann , president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron .
8347	The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a `` response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry , which has been contracting '' since October 1987 's stock market crash , the executive added .
8349	Quotron also provides trading and other systems , services for brokerage firms , and communications-network services .
8350	Independent providers of financial information , including Quotron , have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue .
8351	Shearson , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data .
8353	The company has no immediate plans to close any operations , she said , but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house , including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data .
8354	The spokeswoman said the move is n't directly a response to Quotron 's loss of its two biggest customers , Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , to Automated Data Processing Inc. earlier this year .
8362	The 1989 Series , disrupted by a devastating earthquake and diminished in national interest because both teams came from the San Francisco Bay area , is likely to end up as the lowest-rated Series of this decade and probably since the event has been broadcast .
8365	The sweep by the A's , whose pitchers and home-run hitters dominated the injury-prone Giants , will only make things worse for ABC , owned by Capital Cities\/ABC Inc .
8370	A network spokesman would n't comment , and ABC Sports officials declined to be interviewed .
8371	But some industry executives said ABC , in anticipation of a four-game sweep , limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the third and fourth games .
8372	A World Series telecast typically carries 56 30-second commercials , but by the fourth game ABC was cramming in 60 to 62 ads to generate extra revenue .
8375	But other industry executives contend the losses could reach $ 250 million over four years and could go even higher if the World Series end in four-game romps .
8380	Then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of 11 days .
8385	Bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher .
8390	Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account , and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients .
8393	But interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports .
8396	Both are expected to show continued sluggishness , which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks .
8398	But declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered gainers 774 to 684 , and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged .
8400	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained about an eighth of a point , or about $ 1.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
8403	In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen , compared with 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen Friday .
8407	Because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the U.S. and Western Europe , Japanese corporations ' reputation as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right .
8408	Their factories may look like sets for a Spielberg movie , but their offices , with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses , are more like scenes from a Dickens novel .
8410	Kawasaki-Rikuso , a freight company , set up its own software subsidiary this year and is spending nearly a year 's profit to more than double the computer terminals at its main office .
8413	Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25 % annually over the next five years , according to some analysts , compared with about 10 % in the U.S. .
8414	And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice .
8419	Japan may be a tough market for outsiders to penetrate , and the U.S. is hopelessly behind Japan in certain technologies .
8420	But for now , at least , Americans are far better at making PCs and the software that runs them .
8423	Lotus Development Corp. has slashed the lag between U.S. and Japan product introductions to six months from three years .
8426	Typical is one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry .
8427	`` Personal Computer '' yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk , and dog-eared copies of Nikkei Computer crowd magazine racks .
8428	But amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real-life PC .
8429	While American PC sales have averaged roughly 25 % annual growth since 1984 and West European sales a whopping 40 % , Japanese sales were flat for most of that time .
8430	Japanese office workers use PCs at half the rate of their European counterparts and one-third that of the Americans .
8432	In the U.S. , PCs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network .
8433	In Japan , many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't communicate with other machines .
8434	The market planning and sales promotion office of Nomura Securities Co. , for example , has more than 30 computers for its 60 workers , a respectable ratio .
8438	To transfer information from one to the other , employees make printouts and enter the data manually .
8440	Meanwhile , a woman sitting next to a new Fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator .
8442	In the U.S. , more than half the PC software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis , according to Lotus .
8448	Some Japanese operations , such as securities-trading rooms , may be ahead of their American counterparts , he says , but `` basically , there 's little analysis done on computers in Japan . ''
8449	Of course , simply buying computers does n't always solve problems , and many American companies have erred by purchasing technology they did n't understand .
8451	Various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand .
8452	Because the Japanese `` alphabet '' is so huge , Japan has no history of typewriter use , and so `` keyboard allergy , '' especially among older workers , remains a common affliction .
8454	While most American employees have their own private space , Japanese `` salarymen '' usually share large , common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact .
8455	Top Japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations .
8457	Besides , a computer processing the Japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability , while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols .
8458	Until recently , much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable .
8461	For the past decade , NEC Corp. has owned more than half the Japanese PC market and ruled it with near-monopoly power .
8466	That spurs competition and growth , allows users to change and mix brands easily , and increases software firms ' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer .
8467	If a record industry lacked a common standard , Sony CD owners could listen to a Sony version of Madonna 's `` Like a Prayer '' but not one made for a Panasonic player .
8469	NEC wo n't release its code , and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system -- all incompatible with each other .
8470	IBM established its standard to try to stop falling behind upstart Apple Computer , but NEC was ahead from the start and did n't need to invite in competitive allies .
8474	`` They hesitate to market NEC-compatible machines ; NEC disapproves of such machines , and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship . ''
8475	The result , according to many analysts , is higher prices and less innovation .
8478	In Japan , `` software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind , because NEC is enjoying a monopoly , '' complains Kazuhiko Nishi , the president of Ascii Corp. , one of Japan 's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies .
8480	An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S. .
8490	`` But new managers will have to be creators and innovators ... and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily , and also shared . ''
8492	Seiko Epson Corp. , a newcomer to the industry , fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year .
8494	Sony Corp. , which temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago , started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market .
8498	Many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard .
8500	That has n't generated much sales , but this summer Microsoft rallied all the major NEC competitors to make their new machines compatible with the IBM OS\/2 standard .
8504	U.S. makers have under 10 % share , compared with half the market in Europe and 80 % at home .
8506	`` If it were an open market , we would have been in in 1983 or 1984 , '' says Eckhard Pfeiffer , who heads Compaq Computer Corp. 's European and international operations .
8512	IBM , though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business , did n't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did , and that was n't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard .
8518	Earlier this year , it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating system and a kanji laser printer .
8519	IBM just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both Japanese and English and that substantially enhances compatibility with its American products .
8526	It is time-consuming -LRB- the abortion part alone lasts three days , and the clinical part comprises a week 's worth of visits -RRB- , bloody -LRB- one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion , although for most it resembles a menstrual period , with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days -RRB- , and painful -LRB- many women require analgesic shots to ease them through -RRB- .
8527	Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects .
8533	No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman 's health or fertility .
8538	However , Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the French physician who invented RU-486 , wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys .
8539	The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it .
8540	All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion .
8546	It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration 's approval for a new drug , and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $ 30 million to $ 70 million .
8547	The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as part of its $ 8 million contraceptive program .
8548	But the Population Council , a 37-year-old , $ 20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives , has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer , Roussel-Uclaf , a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government .
8549	In the year since the pill went on the French market , the National Organization for Women and its offshoot , former NOW President Eleanor Smeal 's Fund for a Feminist Majority , have been trying to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved .
8550	-LRB- Its scare-tactic prediction : the pill `` will be available in the U.S. , either legally or illegally , in no more than 2-5 years . '' -RRB-
8551	Following the feminist and population-control lead has been a generally bovine press .
8553	`` For a woman whose period is late , using RU-486 means no waiting , no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics , and no feet up in stirrups for surgery , '' burbles health writer Laura Fraser .
8557	-LRB- Roussel reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none slips into the black market . -RRB-
8558	Thus , a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines ; an initial visit for medical screening -LRB- anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated -RRB- and to take the pill , a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin , administered either via injection or vaginal suppository , and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted .
8559	Furthermore , because timing is so critical with RU-486 , she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she is pregnant , but just how pregnant she is .
8562	At seven weeks , an embryo is about three-fourths of an inch long and recognizably human .
8563	At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress , a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $ 10 million grant for `` development , evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices , drugs and methods . ''
8567	-LRB- Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth-control pills ? -RRB-
8574	The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988 , net of imports , were understated by $ 20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $ 25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989 .
8578	Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports -- such as inbound tourism ; legal , accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners ; financial , engineering and construction services ; and the like -- were not being counted as exports .
8579	The monthly `` trade deficit '' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials .
8580	In the quarterly balance-of-payments report , those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services , as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S. .
8581	Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered .
8582	The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . -LRB- net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad -RRB- , some exports by professional firms -LRB- a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine -RRB- , and improved data from travel and tourism .
8583	In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion .
8584	Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year .
8585	That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion -LRB- annualized -RRB- rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 .
8589	Too early to tell , but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture .
8590	It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services , but it does suggest that it is our exports of services , and not just borrowing , that is financing our imports of goods .
8593	According to one person familiar with the airline , the buy-out group -- led by United 's pilots union and UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf -- has begun billing UAL for fees and expenses it owes to investment bankers , law firms and banks .
8594	The tab even covers $ 8 million in commitment fees owed to Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , even though their failure to obtain $ 7.2 billion in bank loans for the buy-out was the main reason for its collapse .
8597	The merger agreement says the buy-out group is entitled to be repaid $ 26.7 million in fees for its investment bankers , Lazard Freres & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. , and its law firm , Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
8599	In addition to the $ 8 million for Citicorp and Chase , Salomon Brothers is also owed $ 3 million for promising to make a $ 200 million bridge loan .
8602	But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested , and Mr. Davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with UAL in September unless UAL accepts an offer below $ 300 a share .
8604	Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account , and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether .
8605	At the New York Stock Exchange , which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange 's own listed companies , Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board 's 49 stock specialist firms .
8608	A specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock .
8610	A Big Board spokesman would only say , `` We 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue . ''
8611	The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said it and 20 or more of the Big Board 's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange 's role in program trading .
8613	Merrill has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year , executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades , or about one million shares a day .
8617	Merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading , including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program-driven financial futures .
8618	Merrill , in a statement by Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully , said index arbitrage `` has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility , '' so Merrill wo n't execute such trades until `` effective controls '' are in place .
8619	In stock-index arbitrage , traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options .
8621	Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is .
8622	Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts .
8623	Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's president and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers .
8625	Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
8628	Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index-arbitrage trading , and is second only to Morgan Stanley in overall program trading , which includes index arbitrage .
8630	Kidder denied that GE 's chairman and chief executive , John F. Welch , had anything to do with Kidder 's decision .
8631	But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder 's aggressive use of program trading , and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder 's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business .
8635	A spokeswoman for GE in Fairfield , Conn. , said , `` Absolutely no one spoke to Jack Welch on this subject '' and added , `` Anyone who claims they talked to Jack Welch is n't telling the truth . ''
8641	Meanwhile , Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients .
8645	Mr. Greenberg , noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market 's volatility , said that for the first four months of the firm 's fiscal year beginning in July , stock-index arbitrage had been a `` break-even '' proposition for Bear Stearns .
8648	And there was speculation yesterday that Fidelity Investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of Kemper Corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading .
8655	Charles Wohlstetter , chairman of Contel , who is helping organize the alliance of Big Board-listed firms , said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls , faxes and letters supporting his view that the Big Board has been turned into a `` gambling casino '' by program traders .
8656	`` We are reaching the moment of truth '' on Wall Street , said Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance .
8657	`` -LCB- Wall Street -RCB- is beginning to realize -- as Shakespeare said -- the trouble is not in our stars , but in ourselves . ''

8659	An ancient red-figured Greek kylix , or drinking cup , was recovered backstage at Sotheby 's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago .
8660	Robert Guy , an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum , was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix , which he , as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in `` IFAR Reports , '' knew was stolen .
8661	The timing of his visit was fortuitous ; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall .
8662	To confirm Mr. Guy 's identification , Sotheby 's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax , and the waiting man , apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen , agreed to release it .
8663	The cup had been insured , and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative .
8664	The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home .
8665	A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook , N.Y. , pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips , among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould , 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster , and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids , according to Barbara Hammond , the museum 's director .
8673	Instead , New York City police seized the stolen goods , and Mr. Krisher avoided jail .
8674	He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $ 45,000 .
8677	The air-waybill number was changed en route , and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced , so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing .
8679	Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said , `` It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted . ''
8681	Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured column krater and shipped it from London .
8685	About 140 Mayan , Aztec , Mixtec and Zapotec objects , including some of Mexico 's best-known archaeological treasures , were taken .
8686	The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities , but routine police work led to the recovery .
8687	As it turned out , Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family 's home for a year .
8688	Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine .
8689	Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art .
8691	The artist 's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market , and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988 .
8692	According to a source at the East Europe desk , two previously convicted felons were charged , tried , convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years .
8695	Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye , but Robert Lawrence Trotter , 35 , of Kennett Square , Pa. , took his fooling seriously .
8696	He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge , Conn .
8697	Mr. Trotter 's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle ; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes , folded , faded and crumpled papers and currency .
8699	The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came to see it as a fake .
8700	They persuaded Mr. Trotter to take it back and , with the help of the FBI , taped their conversation with him .
8701	After his arrest , the forger admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard .
8704	Separately , Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. 's U.S. sales arm said they are recalling about 88,500 1988-model Mercury Tracers and 220,000 1986 , 1987 and 1988 model Mazda 323s equipped with 1.6-liter fuel-injected engines to replace the oil filler cap .
8709	Ford said owners should return the cars to dealers so the windshields can be removed and securely reinstalled .
8710	Mazda and Ford said a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine oil in some of the Mercury Tracers and Mazda 323s to deteriorate more rapidly than normal , causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life .
8713	Both also will inspect and replace , if necessary , oil filters and oil strainers , at no charge to owners .
8714	For owners who have followed the recommended oil maintenance schedule , Mazda will extend to five years or 60,000 miles the warranty term for engine damage due to abnormal engine oil deterioration .
8715	The normal term for the 1986 and 1987 model 323 is two years or 24,000 miles ; the term for the 1988 323 is three years or 50,000 miles .
8716	Ford said the term on its warranty is already six years or 60,000 miles .
8720	Ford said the new offer will begin Saturday and run indefinitely .
8722	The high court 's decision , expected next spring , may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency .
8724	It recently reported assets of $ 2.4 billion and liabilities of $ 4 billion .
8730	Termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans , but workers do n't accrue new benefits .
8733	But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall from LTV to federal insurance .
8735	In September 1987 , it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans .
8736	LTV challenged the order , and a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the plans .
8742	But LTV , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed .
8748	The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment , and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call .
8751	Nissan Motor is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating San Francisco quake and Hurricane Hugo .
8753	By advertising disaster relief , these companies are hoping to don a white hat and come out a hero .
8756	Along with Nissan , Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King and New York Life Insurance have tied ads to Red Cross donations .
8757	Other ads do n't bother with the fundraising ; a touching , if self-congratulatory , American Telephone & Telegraph ad that aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in San Francisco and Charleston , S.C. , with interviews of people recounting how AT&T helped .
8758	At Nissan , `` we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money , and we had this airtime on Monday Night Football , '' explains Brooke Mitzel , a Nissan advertising creative manager .
8760	We got some exposure ... and pretty much good will . ''
8762	While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce , advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in days or even hours .
8768	`` People see extra messages in advertising , and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it ... if it 's too transparent ... then consumers will see through that , '' warns John Philip Jones , chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University .
8769	`` It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far , be too pushy , '' agrees Gary Stibel , a principal with New England Consulting Group , Westport , Conn .
8771	Still , he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been `` tasteless '' and that `` the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help .
8775	The campaign , which started last week and runs through Nov. 23 , with funds earmarked for both the quake and Hugo , `` was Barry 's idea , '' a spokeswoman says .
8786	The Red Cross does n't track contributions raised by the disaster ads , but it has amassed $ 46.6 million since it first launched its hurricane relief effort Sept. 23 .
8798	Viacom Broadcasting Inc. definitively agreed to acquire KOFY -LRB- AM -RRB- and KOFY-FM in San Francisco for about $ 19.5 million from Pacific FM Inc .
8799	The Supreme Court let stand a New York court 's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown .
8802	The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug .
8803	On a broader scale , the ruling could encourage other states ' courts to adopt the logic of the New York court , not only in DES cases but in other product-related lawsuits , as well .
8805	Paul Rheingold , a New York lawyer who represents DES victims , said that before the New York ruling , only the states of Washington and Wisconsin had followed the California decision .
8807	`` Generally , when New York and California go one way , it has a tremendous influence on other states , especially small ones , '' said Mr. Rheingold .
8808	The high court refused to hear appeals by Rexall Drug Co. , which went out of business in 1987 and was taken over by RXDC Liquidating Trust ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. , a unit of Squibb Corp. ; and Eli Lilly & Co .
8809	The appeals involved DES , which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use from the 1940s until 1971 to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy .
8810	In 1971 , the FDA banned the use of DES after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug .
8811	Lawsuits over the harm caused by DES have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade .
8812	In many cases , the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used -- the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years -- and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women .
8813	Under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed .
8818	-LRB- Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. vs. Hymowitz , and Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Hymowitz -RRB-
8821	Last year , the Supreme Court defined when companies , such as military contractors , may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract .
8822	In that decision , the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment .
8824	The appeals court said the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision .
8828	A federal district court awarded damages to the families and the appeals court affirmed the award .
8832	-- Let stand the mail fraud and conspiracy conviction of John Lavery , a former vice president of Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp. , a unit of Nestle S.A .
8833	The conviction stemmed from federal charges of consumer fraud for sale of phony infant apple juice between 1978 and 1983 .
8839	He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left .
8844	Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system , schools , mail service , telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition .
8847	Mr. Gonzalez and his colleagues , particularly the finance minister , Carlos Solchaga , are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television -LRB- controlled by the state -RRB- to face their accusers .
8850	In that time more than 1.2 million jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below 17 % from 21 % .
8853	Mr. Gonzalez also has split with the left in reaffirming Spain 's NATO commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the U.S. .
8858	He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
8859	He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years .
8861	They , as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the Spanish model , are supporting the direction Spain is taking .
8864	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
8897	Just when American liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the Contras and their friend Ronald Reagan , along comes Mr. Ortega in Costa Rica this weekend to `` blunder '' into the hands of what are often called conservatives .
8898	Conservatives are the faction in U.S. politics which always said that Mr. Ortega and his friends do n't want to hold an election in Nicaragua .
8900	We suspect Daniel Ortega knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy .
8901	He knows that making George Bush look silly in a photograph with him will trigger Noriegan fulminations , and that announcing an end to the liberals ' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the Contras ' military activities in northern Nicaragua .
8902	Mr. Ortega understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the Sandinista movement is not democratic peace , but nondemocratic unpeace .
8903	It is the presence of internal and external `` enemies '' which justifies the need for a large , active army that Mikhail Gorbachev 's Soviet Union continues to supply with bullets .

8909	The biotechnology concern said Spanish authorities must still clear the price for the treatment , but that it expects to receive such approval by year end .
8912	The Treasury Department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers , which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the U.S. .
8913	In recent testimony on Capitol Hill , Treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements , and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations .
8914	The Treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering .
8915	Among the possibilities the Treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers .
8918	Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $ 10,000 or more .
8922	Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering , criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on U.S. wire systems .
8925	Western Union Corp. took steps to withdraw its proposed debt swap for $ 500 million in high-interest notes and said it is looking at other alternatives for refinancing the debt .
8926	Western Union had said two weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer , which would have replaced $ 500 million in so-called reset notes , now paying 19.25 % annual interest and set to come due in 1992 , with two new issues paying lower interest .
8927	Yesterday the company said it had filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap .
8930	Western Union has had major losses in recent years as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone awry .
8934	Western Union had offered to swap each $ 1,000 face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues : a $ 500 note paying an interest rate starting at 16.75 % annually and rising in later years , due in 1992 , and a $ 500 note , due in 1997 , paying a fixed rate of 17 % and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond .
8935	Western Union must make $ 48 million in interest payments on the reset notes on Dec. 15 , and a company spokesman said it fully intends to meet the payments .
8938	The biotechnology concern said the agreement between its longtime West German distributor , Boehringer-Ingleheim 's Dr. Karl Thomae G.m.b.H. subsidiary , and Hoechst 's Behringwerke subsidiary was an attempt to expand the market for blood-clot drugs in general .
8939	A Genentech spokeswoman said the agreement calls for Hoechst to promote TPA for heart patients and streptokinase for other clot-reducing purposes .
8940	Investors in the over-the-counter market dumped banking and insurance issues , sending the Nasdaq composite index lower for the third consecutive session .
8944	The Nasdaq bank index fell 5.00 to 432.61 , while the insurance index fell 3.56 to 528.56 , and the `` other finance '' index dropped 3.27 to 529.32 .
8951	That 's helping put pressure on both the market 's winners and its losers .
8952	`` The stocks that have been the best are having big pullbacks , and the ones that have been the worst are getting clobbered , '' Mr. Mills said .
8953	He expects the market to sink further and to reach a low sometime next month or in December .
8954	The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well .
8957	Much of the market 's recent volatility has been blamed on this large-scale computerized trading technique that can send stock prices surging or plummeting in a matter of minutes .
8961	Ratners and Weisfield 's said they expect to sign definitive agreements shortly and to complete the transaction by Dec. 15 .
8964	Jaguar assumed its recently customary place on the OTC most active list as its American depository receipts gained 1\/4 to 11 7\/8 on volume of 1.2 million shares and Daimler-Benz joined the list of companies interested in the British car maker .

8983	Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops .
8984	An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention .
8989	Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . ''
8992	But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant .
8994	Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .
8998	A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop .
9000	Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings .
9004	A test using new `` genetic probes '' showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer .
9008	`` It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer , '' says Samuel Broder , director of the National Cancer Institute .
9009	`` All this may not be obvious to the public , which is concerned about advances in treatment , but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon . ''
9013	Soon after that report , two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers .
9014	Colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year .
9015	Right now about a dozen laboratories , in the U.S. , Canada and Britain , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes .
9017	Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix .
9020	He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other .
9023	Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes .
9027	He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer .
9028	But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared .
9037	But in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers .
9042	Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .
9043	They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .
9064	In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .
9065	There also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers .
9066	At the same time , the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes .
9068	Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer , a researcher in Great Britain , are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer , thought to be on chromosome 5 .
9070	Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too .
9072	Already two major pharmaceutical companies , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies .
9073	Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes .
9082	Michael wo n't confirm the identities of any Easy Egg customers , nor will it say much of anything else .
9085	But at least Burger King has signed on , and says that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs .
9090	A company official says Michael 's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product .
9092	There has been no announcement of the Burger King arrangement by either party , possibly for fear that McDonald 's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising .
9095	The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment .
9096	Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender .
9098	`` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but -LCB- because -RCB- the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth .
9100	The CEO , Richard G. Olson , replied `` yes , '' but would n't elaborate .
9106	Earnings are n't keeping pace , he says , because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business .
9107	Mr. Carver , however , believes the company 's egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run , even though it `` makes sense -- it 's more convenient '' and justifies its price , which is higher than shell eggs , because of health and sanitation concerns .
9114	Michael , which also processes potatoes , still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit .
9115	But dry growing conditions in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what Michael contracted to pay last spring .
9118	Pierre Peladeau , a Canadian newspaper publisher little-known in the U.S. , figures to become a big player in North American printing -- and his ambitions do n't end there .
9119	Yesterday , Quebecor Inc. , a Montreal printing , publishing and forest-products company 53%-owned by Mr. Peladeau , agreed to acquire Maxwell Communication Corp. 's U.S. printing subsidiary , Maxwell Graphics Inc. , for $ 500 million in cash and securities .
9121	The printing customers that Quebecor will gain through Maxwell Graphics include the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade , Time , Sports Illustrated and TV Guide .
9122	But the transaction is just Mr. Peladeau 's latest step in a larger design : to build Quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper , publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout North America .
9132	Quebecor started the Philadelphia Journal , a daily tabloid , in 1977 and closed it three years later .
9134	More recently , some former Quebecor executives started their own printing company , specializing in printing and distributing advertising circulars .
9137	The tabloid 's circulation soared to 80,000 , but plunged to under 10,000 when the La Presse strike ended .
9139	Now the Journal , flush with ads and hugely profitable , is even with La Presse in weekend circulation and outsells it 3 to 2 every weekday .
9140	Mr. Peladeau has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid , a brash mix of crime and sports .
9143	Quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in Montreal , the struggling 18-month-old Montreal Daily News ; dailies in Quebec City and Winnipeg , Manitoba ; and dozens of weeklies covering most of Quebec .
9145	After a recent merger , it is also the only province-wide distributor of magazines and newspapers in Quebec .
9146	Finally , with Maxwell Communication , the company controls 54 % of Donohue Inc. , a Quebec City pulp and paper concern .
9147	In yesterday 's accord , Quebecor agreed to pay $ 400 million in cash for Maxwell Graphics , and to give Maxwell Communication a 20 % stake , valued at $ 100 million , in Quebecor 's new printing subsidiary .
9148	The new , as yet unnamed , subsidiary will combine Quebecor 's existing printing unit and Maxwell Graphics .
9149	It will have 61 plants from coast to coast and $ 1.5 billion in annual sales .
9152	Pierre-Karl Peladeau , the founder 's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition , says Quebecor has n't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase , but he says it most likely will use debt .
9154	Last October , Quebecor bought 23 Canadian printing plants from BCE Inc. , a Montreal telecommunications , manufacturing , energy and real estate company .
9157	According to its most recent annual report , covering the 15 months ended March 31 , Maxwell Communication bought $ 3.85 billion in assets -- including Macmillan Inc. and Official Airlines Guides -- and sold $ 2 billion in non-strategic businesses .
9163	G.D. Searle & Co. said the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone , a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern .
9164	Searle , a unit of Monsanto Co. , said the `` beta-blocker '' high-blood-pressure drug Kerlone is the first product to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals , the U.S. company jointly owned by Searle and Synthelabo , a French pharmaceutical concern owned by France 's L'Oreal S.A .
9169	The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination .
9170	The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of -LRB- New York 's -RRB- unlawful employment practices . ''
9173	The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said .
9174	`` I 've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities . ''
9177	Most New York judges are elected , and the federal age-discrimination law does n't apply to elected officials , said James L. Lee , regional attorney for the EEOC in New York .
9178	Under New York law , elected judges must retire at age 70 , but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76 .
9181	In Connecticut , however , most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature .
9184	Aaron Ment , Connecticut 's chief court administrator , declined to comment on the suit and the EEOC 's intervention .
9185	He said the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 `` trial referees , '' who are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench .
9187	U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh 's plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is expected to go into effect next month , despite the opposition of Democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units .
9188	The units are autonomous from U.S. attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases .
9191	Mr. Thornburgh will be free to disband the strike forces after Congress approves a $ 479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies , according to David Runkel , a Justice Department spokesman .
9195	They predict that organized-crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to U.S. attorneys ' offices .
9200	He says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan .
9210	The 204-lawyer New York firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from Golenbock & Barell , which will dissolve Dec. 31 .
9213	Whitman & Ransom managing partner Maged F. Riad said the Golenbock recruits will enhance the firm 's corporate and litigation departments .
9216	The woman appeared in court Thursday to enter her plea , but when she started to approach the bench , she was stopped by Judge Hancock .
9219	Kelly Siegler , an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom , disputed suggestions the action was sexist , saying she had seen Judge Hancock turn away male defendants dressed in shorts , tank tops or muscle shirts `` many times . ''
9221	Warner Communications Inc. and Sony Corp. resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters , but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents .
9222	Warner has filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and the Guber-Peters duo , who in turn are countersuing Warner for trying to interfere in Sony 's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber Peters Entertainment Co. in two transactions valued at over $ 5 billion .
9224	Yesterday , in documents filed in connection with that case , Warner accused Sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for Columbia , citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings made by Sony that described the contracts .
9225	Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff , president of its CBS Records unit , said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement .
9226	Wayne Smith , an attorney at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony , said the Sony executives had n't seen the contract because `` it was n't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time . ''
9227	Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo .
9228	Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs. Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up .
9229	But Mr. Smith said Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio .
9230	Warner described as `` nonsense '' yesterday Sony 's assertions in prior court filings that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could in theory run Columbia while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for Warner .
9231	Such a dual role would be `` impractical and unethical , '' Warner said , adding , `` that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the San Francisco Giants . ''
9238	Boeing Co. 's third-quarter profit leaped 68 % , but Wall Street 's attention was focused on the picket line , not the bottom line .
9239	In fact , the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world 's No. 1 jet maker and the striking Machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks .
9240	Doug Hammond , the federal mediator in Seattle , where Boeing is based , said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again .
9242	For the third quarter , net rose to $ 242 million , or $ 1.05 a share , from $ 144 million , or 63 cents a share .
9244	Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined .
9245	The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either Boeing or its work force .
9248	And the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other non-striking employees on hand .
9249	Before the union rejected the company 's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of Oct. 4 , Boeing had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period .
9252	`` But it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year . ''
9253	Phillip Brannon of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets added : `` You do n't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it .
9257	Still , Boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside .
9258	In a statement , Chairman Frank Shrontz asserted that the company `` faces significant challenges and risks , '' on both its commercial and government contracts .
9259	For instance , he noted that spending on Pentagon programs is shrinking , and Boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects , including the B-2 Stealth bomber , the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Air Force 's next-generation tactical fighter .
9261	Moreover , Mr. Shrontz added , production-rate increases that have been implemented on the 737 , 747 , 757 and 767 programs have resulted in `` serious work force skill-dilution problems . ''
9262	Suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules .
9264	Besides the Machinists pact , accords representing 30,000 of the company 's engineering and technical employees in the Puget Sound and Wichita , Kan. , areas expire in early December .
9266	This contract , covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers , is being extended on a day-to-day basis .
9267	The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10 % base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract , plus bonuses of 8 % the first year and 3 % the second .
9270	The company reiterated yesterday that it 's willing to reconfigure the package , but not add to the substance of it .
9271	For the nine months , Boeing 's net increased 36 % to $ 598 million , or $ 2.60 a share , from $ 440 million , or $ 1.92 a share .
9279	The application by Foothills , owned by Calgary-based Nova Corp. of Alberta and Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver , Canada , is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in Canada 's Mackenzie River delta .
9283	Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from Canada 's National Energy Board to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. starting in 1996 .
9284	The producers include Shell Canada Ltd. , a unit of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group ; Esso Resources Canada Ltd. , a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. , which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp. ; and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. , a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd .
9289	Industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between TransCanada , which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta , and Nova and Westcoast , which control the pipelines within and running west of Alberta , respectively .
9290	`` This is virgin territory , unclaimed , and it 's going to be nasty , '' said one observer , who asked not to be named .
9293	But last week Gerald Maier , president and chief executive officer of TransCanada , said the company `` intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there '' and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role .
9298	U.S. gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for Mackenzie delta gas or develop Alaskan reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area first , a project that has been on hold for more than a decade .
9299	Robert Pierce , chairman and chief executive of Foothills , said it 's too early to say whether Alaskan or Mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first .
9301	If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , Foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline .
9303	Douglas Stoneman , vice president of Shell Canada , noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development .
9305	Instead , Richard Haskayne , president and chief executive of Interprovincial 's Calgary-based parent , Interhome Energy Inc. , said the company would prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal .
9309	In recent years , unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make low-interest loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the Fed about reinvestment act compliance .
9310	Few petitions , however , have actually delayed or scuttled mergers .
9313	The petition challenged First Union 's lending record in the state , saying that the bank-holding company had `` shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state . ''
9314	In deferring action on the merger , the Fed said , `` The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow -LCB- it -RCB- to reach a final conclusion on First Union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities . ''
9315	The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union 's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks .
9316	First Union , with assets of about $ 32 billion , said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities .
9319	It said yesterday it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in 1990 .
9339	Earlier this month the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , the experts hired by the creditors , contended that Eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting .
9342	The consultants maintained Eastern would n't generate the cash it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan .
9343	Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base . ''
9344	Yesterday , Joel Zweibel , an attorney for Eastern 's creditors committee , declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to .
9345	He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating .
9347	Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size .
9349	Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid , and the two sides had to begin negotiating again .
9350	Eastern has publicly stated it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings early next year , operating more flights than it originally had scheduled .
9351	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
9353	$ 813.4 million of general obligation bonds , Fiscal 1990 Series C and D , including $ 757.4 million of tax-exempt bonds and $ 56 million of taxable bonds , tentatively priced by a Goldman Sachs & Co. group .
9355	Yields for taxable bonds range from 9 1\/8 % in 1994 to 9.90 % in 2009 and 2010 .
9360	The offering , Series 1989-3 , is by a company established by First Boston for issuing Remics and other derivative mortgage securities .
9361	It is backed by Government National Mortgage Association 9 1\/2 % securities with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 29 years and being offered at market prices .
9366	The offering is rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P , based on the quality of the underlying home equity loans and a letter of credit covering 10 % of the deal from Union Bank of Switzerland .
9371	The offering has an expected average life of 1.7 years and a final maturity date of May 15 , 1995 .
9372	The issue is rated triple-A by Moody 's , based on the quality of the underlying auto loans and a letter of credit covering 13 % of the deal from Credit Suisse .
9384	West German insurance giant Allianz AG entered the takeover battle between France 's Cie . Financiere de Paribas and Cie. de Navigation Mixte .
9385	Allianz said it won French government approval to buy as much as one-third of Navigation Mixte , a diversified financial , transport and food holding company .
9388	That would be a blow to both Paribas and Navigation Mixte .
9393	Deutsche Bank , Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to expand in France before 1992 .
9394	Dresdner Bank this month moved to acquire Banque Internationale des Placements , a small French merchant bank that Deutsche Bank had looked at and passed over .
9395	Commerzbank had hoped to buy a stake in Credit Lyonnais , until the Socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans to privatize the large French bank .
9399	`` The banks we think would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale , though Deutsche Bank would be able to pay a good price . ''
9400	While Allianz officials were n't willing to comment in any detail on their plans , they said Allianz currently holds between 5 % and 10 % of Navigation Mixte , an apparent increase from the 5 % stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced .
9401	Paris market sources said they believed Allianz was buying yesterday morning , and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs -LRB- $ 17.19 -RRB- to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading .
9417	Paribas already holds about 18.7 % of Navigation Mixte , and the acquisition of the additional 48 % would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid .
9420	The company said Carol Cable , based in Pawtucket , R.I. , is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor , retail and original equipment manufacturer markets .
9421	Carol Cable , which operates 12 manufacturing plants , had operating profit of $ 11.7 million on sales of $ 153.3 million for the first six months of this year and operating profit of $ 25.6 million on sales of $ 294.6 million for all of 1988 .
9422	The maker of telecommunications and defense equipment said Carol Cable 's portfolio and market focus would complement the company 's current wire and cable businesses .
9423	The plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of Carol Cable by Penn Central , a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals .
9424	Fletcher Challenge Ltd. said its Petrocorp unit agreed to acquire certain Alberta oil and gas interests from Amoco Corp. 's Canadian unit , for about 130 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 110.6 million -RRB- .
9425	Fletcher Challenge , a big New Zealand-based forest products concern with forestry operations in Canada , said the assets include stakes in four natural gas fields and one oil field near Provost , Alberta , plus gas processing facilities and about 247,000 acres of undeveloped land .
9428	Petrocorp , a New Zealand-based oil and gas producer , said the planned purchase would be its first oil and gas acquisition outside its home country , and would form the basis for a new stand-alone exploration and production unit in Canada .
9429	MiniScribe Corp. , Longmont , Colo. , said it introduced a one-inch high , 80-megabyte hard disk drive that it hopes will prove popular with makers of high-performance laptop and portable computers .
9430	The troubled disk drive maker aims with the new 3 1\/2-inch disks to revive its reputation and sales growth .
9432	MiniScribe said it expects to begin full volume production of the drives in the U.S. and Singapore in the first quarter next year .
9435	After an internal investigation , the company found that senior officials used a variety of schemes to fabricate sales gains , including counting shipments of bricks and defective drives as sales .
9438	The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $ 3.6 million over six years , as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years , based on the number of `` new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures , '' the Times said .
9443	Mercury Savings & Loan Association , Huntington Beach , Calif. , reported a third-quarter loss of $ 3.9 million , or 61 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 1.4 million , or 22 cents a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
9444	Mercury attributed the loss to rapid prepayments of loans and costs incurred in refinancing many house loans this past spring and summer , when interest rates dipped .
9445	The thrift hired an investment banker earlier this month to advise it regarding a possible sale or merger .
9447	Such a focus is `` more profitable , more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control , '' said William A. Shane , Mercury 's senior executive vice president .
9449	For the nine months , Mercury posted a loss of $ 5.4 million , or 86 cents share , against net income of $ 4 million , or 63 cents share , a year earlier .
9452	Sigmund Levine , Bancroft secretary and treasurer , said the closed-end fund 's directors will consider Mr. Green 's offer in a couple of weeks at a regular meeting .
9454	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Green said he had boosted his holdings in Bancroft common to 10.4 % from 8.5 % , and renewed an offer he made in March to acquire the fund .
9455	Mr. Levine noted that Bancroft 's shares have been trading at or above Mr. Green 's offering price for the last several months .
9459	Rally 's , a fast-food chain based in Louisville , Ky. , is contending that Mr. Sugarman and two other company directors failed to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission that they intended to acquire a big Rally stake .
9464	Rally 's had no comment , but was expected to make an announcement this morning about the situation .
9467	The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing , but she declined , citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work .
9468	The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler 's 1973 hit song `` Do You Wanna Dance . ''
9469	The appeals court held : `` When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product , the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs . ''
9471	In a statement , Young & Rubicam called the award `` unfortunate but bearable . ''
9472	Peter Laird , a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler , said , `` We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers .
9476	The appeals-court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product .
9478	At that time , the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law , which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances .
9479	`` One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is .
9482	`` It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form , '' he said .
9485	The Dutch unit , known as Celtona B.V. , is a leading maker of consumer and away-from-home tissue products for the Benelux region .
9486	In addition , the acquisition includes production assets of Invercon Papermils , a maker of household tissue products for the U.K. and Ireland .
9488	James River , a maker of pulp , paper and plastic products , already has interests in tissue businesses in France , Spain , Italy and Turkey .
9489	The company said it plans to form European ventures with Italian and Finnish companies .
9492	The agreements are with Security Pacific National Bank and an affiliate of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
9493	Proceeds of the loan agreement , together with funds from Vitro , will permit the purchase of all shares outstanding of Anchor and the payment of all related costs and expenses .
9499	Some analysts predict that in the absence of market-moving news to push the U.S. unit sharply higher or lower , the currency is likely to drift below 1.80 marks this week .
9500	But others reject the view , and forecast the dollar will continue to hold its current tight trading pattern .
9501	They argue that weakness in both the yen and sterling have helped offset bearish U.S. economic news and have lent support to the dollar .
9502	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks , up from 1.8300 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , up from 141.65 yen late Friday .
9504	The dollar rose against the Swiss and French francs .
9508	Traders said that statements made over the weekend to quell concern about the stability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's government and the future of her economic program largely failed to reassure investors and bolster the flagging British unit .
9509	In her first televised interview following Mr. Lawson 's resignation , Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her desire to keep sterling strong and warned again that full entry into the European Monetary System 's exchange rate mechanism would provide no easy solution to Britain 's economic troubles .
9516	`` There is no question that the situation is bad , but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should , '' he said .
9517	He predicts the pound will continue to trade in a very volatile fashion , with `` fits of being oversold and overbought '' before recovering its losses .
9519	They observe that persistent Japanese investor demand for dollars for both portfolio and direct investment has kept a base of support for the dollar at around 140 yen .
9525	General Electric Capital Corp. 's Monogram Bank USA acquired a Visa and MasterCard portfolio from Commercial Federal Savings & Loan Association , an Omaha , Neb. , unit of Commercial Federal Corp. of Omaha .
9528	GE Capital is a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. of Fairfield , Conn. , which also has broadcasting and electrical-products businesses .
9529	GE Capital said Commercial Federal Savings will continue to market Visa and MasterCard programs while Monogram provides `` operational and marketing support '' and actually owns the accounts .
9532	As the country 's new leader , Egon Krenz , prepared to travel to Moscow today for talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev , hundreds of thousands of East Germans massed in the streets of Leipzig , Halle and Schwerin to call for internal freedoms and the legalization of the New Forum opposition group .

9571	Nixdorf Computer AG , citing continued profitability problems , said it will have to reduce personnel further , notably in research and development sectors .
9574	The cuts will be made half within Germany and half abroad .
9575	In the first nine months of 1989 , Nixdorf said , sales rose 5 % amid good growth in selected areas such as banks and trading companies .
9576	The company also cited some success in damping cost increases and said it wants to return to profitability in 1990 .
9577	It cited the expected beneficial effects of a concentration on key products , further structural changes within the group and cooperation agreements with other companies .

9642	The French Economics Ministry approved a planned asset swap between the defense and electronics group Thomson-CSF S.A. and the bank group Credit Lyonnais .
9643	The ministry said the swap , details of which were disclosed last Thursday , will allow both state-controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of France 's state-sector concerns .
9647	The move will help the bank to keep up with international solvency ratios being phased in by the Bank for International Settlements and will also represent the first time that its voting shares have been held by a party other than the government .
9648	Bio-Technology General Corp. received tenders for 97.9 % of its 7.5 % convertible senior subordinated notes due April 15 , 1997 , and 96 % of its 11 % convertible senior subordinated debentures due March 1 , 2006 .
9649	In exchange offers that expired Friday , holders of each $ 1,000 of notes will receive $ 250 face amount of Series A 7.5 % senior secured convertible notes due Jan. 15 , 1995 , and 200 common shares .
9650	For each $ 1,000 face amount of debentures , holders received $ 250 of Series B 11 % senior secured convertible notes due Oct. 15 , 1998 , and 200 common shares .
9651	Bio-Technology , a New York maker of genetically engineered products for human and animal health care , said it made the exchange offer to reduce its interest payments .
9655	Its bid : one yen , or less than a U.S. penny .
9665	`` I understand the firm 's enthusiasm in getting the deal , but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion . ''
9667	The Fujitsu spokeswoman said headquarter officials did n't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing does n't happen in the future .
9670	The system could be used in a fire or earthquake to locate problems , among other things .
9674	Japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years , and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue .
9675	`` In the near future , it will be a big market , not just for waterworks , but for all mapping systems , '' the Fujitsu spokeswoman said .
9681	Three competitors bid between 300,000 yen and 500,000 yen , according to the Hiroshima government office .
9683	American Airlines will expand its trans-Atlantic service 30 % beginning next year with six new daily flights between the U.S. and Europe , officials announced yesterday .
9685	The new nonstop flights , starting next May , will include Chicago-Warsaw , Chicago-Helsinki , Miami-Madrid , Dallas-Barcelona , a second daily Chicago-Paris flight and a second daily Chicago-Manchester flight , the officials said .
9688	The additions solidify American 's position as the third-largest U.S. transatlantic carrier , behind PanAm Corp. 's Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines .
9691	Earnings at the department-store division , which generates the bulk of profit , should remain at least stable , while income at the mail-order and tourism units is likely to fall slightly from 1988 , the company said .
9692	Karstadt did n't give any group sales or profit figures for the first nine months .
9693	Georgia-Pacific Corp. offered to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $ 58 a share , or about $ 3.18 billion .
9695	Executives at Nekoosa could n't be reached , and officials at Georgia Pacific declined to comment .
9698	The two companies would appear to be a logical fit because of their complementary lines , and analysts described the offer , representing a 36 % premium over Nekoosa 's market price , as fair .
9702	International Paper or Weyerhaeuser could step in . ''
9704	That collapse , following on the heels of disarray in the market for high-risk , high-yield bonds , cast doubt on the entire takeover business , which has fueled both big profits among Wall Street securities firms and big gains in the stock market generally .
9707	According to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report , options trading in Nekoosa was also heavy , ranking only behind International Business Machines Corp. and UAL in volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange .
9709	Value Line added , `` With discounts widening on business papers , and with newsprint and corrugated shipments flat , we expect negative earnings comparisons through next year . ''
9710	By contrast , Value Line said Georgia-Pacific `` is in a comparatively good position to deal with weakening paper markets , '' because its production is concentrated not in the Northwest but in the South , where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices .
9711	Also , it is n't exposed to the weakening newsprint business , and is strong in the less-cyclical tissue business .
9715	Ratners Group PLC 's U.S. subsidiary has agreed to acquire jewelry retailer Weisfield 's Inc. for $ 50 a share , or about $ 55 million .
9717	Ratners and Weisfield 's said they reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of Weisfield 's by Sterling Inc .
9721	In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 , the company reported sales of $ 59.5 million and pretax profit of $ 2.9 million .
9724	McDonnell Douglas Corp. received contracts totaling $ 244.8 million for 72 F-A-18 aircraft for the Navy and helicopter spare parts for the Army .
9731	The company , which makes integrated circuits and other electronic parts , now has about 47 million common shares outstanding .
9734	The media 's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War , the Carter administration 's denigration of the military , and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there .
9735	The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership , not leadership , it creates guilt about wearing the uniform , and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts ' role , i.e. , to be able to win if called on .
9739	Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan -LRB- U.S. naval officer and naval historian -RRB- and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom .
9740	Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force -LRB- the carrier fleet -RRB- and its own army -LRB- the Marines -RRB- , which in turn has its own air force .
9741	Of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security , but Mr. Lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer .
9745	I personally do not want to hasten Mr. Lehman 's demise , but I can see him figuring prominently in his own article .
9748	Gone is D. Joseph Corr , the airline 's chairman , chief executive and president , appointed only last December .
9751	Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo , chairman and chief executive of Continental 's parent , Texas Air Corp .
9754	Mr. Foret , 44 , is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines , its predecessor .
9755	Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air .
9763	Continental is Texas Air 's flagship and was built painfully to its present size under Mr. Lorenzo after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986 .
9766	During his tenure , Mr. Corr attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company 's future plans , traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier 's image .
9771	Among the other alumni are Stephen Wolf , now chairman of UAL Inc. , and Thomas Plaskett , president of Pan Am Corp .
9772	Doskocil Cos. said its bank-debt payments have been extended until May 31 , 1990 , to give it more time to sell its Wilson Foods Corp. retail and fresh meat operations .
9773	The company was to repay $ 58 million in debt on Dec. 31 and $ 15 million on March 31 .
9775	An agreement to sell the Wilson assets for $ 150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September , when the buyer , a company controlled by George Gillett , could n't secure financing .
9777	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
9778	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
9784	Australia 's inflation is expected to rise as high as 8.3 % in the quarter ending March 30 , but could fall to around 7 % by June , according to economists .
9785	The government said the consumer price index rose 2.3 % in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from the previous quarter and 8 % from a year ago .
9788	Charles R. Simpson Jr. , 46 , president and chief operating officer , will assume the chief executive 's post .
9791	Farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons laughing and gossiping at the markets .
9793	For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s , the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame .
9797	That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world 's supply of flea seed , also known as flea wort or , in Western parlance , psyllium : a tiny , tasteless , obscure seed that , according to early research , may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood .
9800	`` This seed 's not grown anywhere else in India , or anywhere else in the world , '' says T.V. Krishnamurthy , a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd. , a major psyllium buyer and promoter .
9802	Arvind Patel , a processor and exporter of the seed , raves : `` If psyllium takes the place of oat bran , it will be huge . ''
9803	Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur 's fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and , of course , the outcome of further research .
9805	Local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek , a legume .
9806	But they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning , and , perhaps , little need : lean , frugal vegetarians , the farmers are innocents in the clogged , treacherous world of cholesterol .
9807	Psyllium is an annual herb , Plantago ovata , that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here , mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal .
9811	'' Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney , bladder and urethra problems , duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids .
9813	The plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and diminutive seeds .
9814	It is the seed 's colorlessness and size -- 1,000 of them weigh only 1.5 grams , or about as much as two paper clips -- that explain the historical allusions to fleas .
9815	The transluscent husk of the seed is removed , sifted and crushed ; the seed itself is fed to animals .
9817	For decades , psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as Procter & Gamble Co. 's Metamucil , the top-selling brand in the U.S. , and Ciba-Geigy Corp. 's Fiberall .
9819	Cincinnati-based P&G took an interest ; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol .
9821	After 16 weeks , the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels , and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins , the so-called bad cholesterol .
9824	General Mills Inc. , the food giant , launched a breakfast cereal called Benefit , containing psyllium , oat , wheat and beet bran ; the words , `` reduce cholesterol '' were prominently displayed on its package .
9826	Suddenly , on television , in advertisements and on their cereal boxes , Americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed .
9827	The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals .
9828	This month , the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday , in various forms , ingest too much psyllium .
9830	The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe .
9836	In the newspapers , on the radio and TV , psyllium is everywhere . ''
9838	They only know of one use for the crop , as a laxative , and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop , they think of the seed as a marginal crop , something to grow between summer wheat crops .
9840	You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined . ''
9841	Even at the Basic Chemicals , Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council , the government agency that promotes the seed , the psyllium boom is distant thunder .
9843	The council 's annual report has psyllium on its last page , lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and `` Nux vomica , '' a plant that induces vomiting .
9844	In one way , the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves .
9847	Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities .
9849	Psyllium needs sandy soil , dew during the first few weeks , and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing .
9850	Small crops are grown in Pakistan , France , Spain , Italy , Belgium and Brazil , but their quality ca n't compare to that of Indian psyllium .
9851	Big buyers like Procter & Gamble say there are other spots on the globe , and in India , where the seed could be grown .
9852	`` It 's not a crop that ca n't be doubled or tripled , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy .
9855	Many farmers , too removed to glean psyllium 's new sparkle in the West , have decided to plant mustard , fennel , cumin , fenugreek or castor-oil seeds .
9856	Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel .
9861	Kellwood Co. said it completed a previously announced acquisition of Crowntuft Manufacturing Corp. , a New York-based maker of chenille robes and lounge wear .
9872	She said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases , and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment .
9873	For employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread .
9874	Surveys repeatedly show that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns .
9875	The House Energy and Commerce Committee 's health subcommittee , headed by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California , is looking into complaints that small businesses not only ca n't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed , but often ca n't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable .
9877	What we 're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance : collect premiums from the healthy , dump the sick and let them pay their own bills . ''
9880	As larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills , the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them .
9881	`` Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide .
9882	`` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % .
9884	In addition , the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce , hemorrhoids and overweight .
9892	Rep. Waxman and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem .
9894	But small-business lobbyists say they support the idea , included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill , of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating , which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group , and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients .
9898	She contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs 20 % in Maryland and 30 % in California .
9900	`` It just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy . ''
9905	The Belgian consumer price index rose a provisional 0.1 % in October from the previous month and was up 3.64 % from October 1988 , the Ministry of Economic Affairs said .
9908	Belgium 's inflation has been rising steadily for the past year , but the ministry said the latest rise is slower than gains in September and August .
9910	Nashua immediately responded by strengthening a poison-pill plan and saying it will buy back up to one million of its shares , or 10.4 % of the 9.6 million outstanding .
9911	Nashua , whose major business is selling copiers , facsimile machines and related supplies , said Reiss & Co . B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $ 15 million of Nashua 's stock but less than 25 % .
9914	But the company has had weak results so far this year , with earnings declining 43 % to $ 13.7 million , or $ 1.43 a share , on a 4 % decline in revenue to $ 713.5 million through the first nine months of the year .
9923	In addition to selling Japanese-made photocopiers and facsimile machines in Europe and copier supplies in the U.S. , Nashua has three other major businesses : labels and tapes , data storage disks for computers and mail-order photofinishing .
9924	The closely held supermarket chain named Frank Nicastro vice president and treasurer .
9930	A spokesman for the retail jeweler said the company would provide more details today and that it expects to reach a definitive agreement by the end of the week .
9940	Today , with business activity in Hong Kong staggering along at an uneven pace , the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear .
9943	But in the stock and real-estate markets , activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground .
9944	Waning demand reported by importers , retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt .
9945	As many economists and businessmen see it , those incongruities underscore a paradox that seems likely to bedevil the economy throughout the 1990s .
9948	China 's land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry .
9951	These benefits seem secure despite China 's current economic and political troubles .
9955	That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation 's democracy movement .
9956	Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s .
9957	A widely held assumption all along has been that , given its robust economy , Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows .
9958	With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4 , that assumption no longer seems so safe .
9959	Investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition .
9960	Only four months have passed since the Beijing massacre , and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact .
9961	The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely .
9966	But with local investors shaken by China 's political and economic turmoil , she says , a genuine recovery may not arrive until Hong Kong can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty .
9969	In a soon-to-be published book on the territory , a political economist , Miron Mushkat , has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 Hong Kong government officials and businessmen .
9971	The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect Hong Kong to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos .
9974	The consensus of this group , which he dubs `` realists , '' is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3 % and 5 % .
9978	The other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash .
9986	Going by official forecasts of GDP , which measures the colony 's output of goods and services , minus foreign income , Mr. Mushkat 's `` realists '' seem relatively close to the mark .
9988	The updated forecast , published Aug. 25 , compares with an earlier forecast of 6 % published March 1 and a 7.4 % rate achieved in
10001	Once external conditions , such as U.S. demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they argue , local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual .
10003	Many are refugees , having fled China 's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949 .
10004	As a result , many of those now planning to leave Hong Kong ca n't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate .
10005	Emigration applications soared in 1985 , when Britain and China ratified their accord on Hong Kong 's future .
10009	A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals .
10013	Bowing to a mounting public outcry , three more major securities firms -- Bear , Stearns & Co. Inc. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Oppenheimer & Co. -- announced Friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts .
10017	Wells Fargo Investment Advisers , Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street , trading executives say .
10018	These huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the S&P 500 stock index or other stock indexes , and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits .
10028	Stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole .
10033	Stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool , but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage , in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences .
10035	And while signs of an economic slowdown , softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market 's recent weakness , many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings .
10038	Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Founders Asset Management Inc. also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading .
10041	Indeed , Morgan Stanley 's president , Richard B. Fisher , said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators , investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially induces stock-market volatility .
10042	`` We have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial volatility , '' Mr. Fisher said .
10044	Joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action , Merrill Lynch & Co. recommended program-trading reforms late Friday , including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination .
10048	Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility .
10049	These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line .
10050	Stock-index arbitrage , because it sells the more `` expensive '' market and buys the `` cheaper '' one , attempts to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets , and the adjustments are often abrupt .
10054	Like so many trends in the entertainment industry , the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest .
10057	Put these together , and you get programs about rape .
10059	In the series , Virgil Tibbs -LRB- Howard Rollins -RRB- and his wife , Althea -LRB- Anne-Marie Johnson -RRB- have settled in Sparta , Miss .
10064	But it 's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry : `` Fear of violence and animosity ... because of race or religion , fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people ... produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers . ''
10065	The writer and executive producer of `` Settle the Score , '' Steve Sohmer , is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary , aired this summer , in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation .
10066	At one point in the documentary , Mr. Sohmer , who is Jewish , says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale .
10072	The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate -LRB- Jaclyn Smith -RRB- , and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk , a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex .
10073	I mean , these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen-ager , someone tied her hands behind her back , thrust her head into a gunny sack , brutally raped and beat her , and then left her to die in a cold-storage room .
10074	Her Pa -LRB- Howard Duff -RRB- is the kind of guy who , while saying grace at the supper table , pauses at the word `` sin '' and glares at the daughter he has n't seen for two decades , because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room , and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of Chicago .
10077	Every man Kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical , viciously patronizing , revoltingly lecherous , or all three .
10078	Add the fact that any one of them , including Pa , could be her attacker , and you have a setting that does n't resemble small-town America , or even Hollywood 's nightmare of small-town America , so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood 's `` The Handmaid 's Tale , '' itself soon to be -LRB- you guessed it -RRB- a Hollywood movie .
10079	There are two exceptions : Josh -LRB- Jeffrey DeMunn -RRB- , the local doctor who has always loved Kate ; and Lincoln -LRB- Richard Masur -RRB- , Kate 's simple-minded but affectionate brother .
10080	Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she 's seething with anger and fear , but we know from the outset that he 's not a member of the evil patriarchy .
10086	Her sister-in-law -LRB- Amy Wright -RRB- is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town , including a particularly loathsome fellow named Tucker , whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns , while he bullies Kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs .
10089	In the aforementioned episode of `` In the Heat of the Night , '' we saw Althea being attacked , but we were n't invited to enjoy the spectacle .
10090	In Mr. Sohmer 's film , by contrast , we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim , as the camera ogles Kate in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape .
10091	At this point , the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy .
10094	'' Or the one in which she and Josh are stranded in the city , and , after insisting on separate motel rooms , she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape -- wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push-up bra .
10097	Crossland Savings Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 .
10099	A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the `` core capital '' criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
10101	Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .
10103	Additionally , Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ 175.5 million , or $ 13.44 a share , compared with net income of $ 27.1 million , or $ 1.16 a share , a year ago .
10105	The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and , consequently , to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions .
10110	Standard & Poor 's Corp. lowered the rating on Crossland 's preferred stock to double-C from single-B-minus and placed it on CreditWatch for possible further downgrade .
10111	It also placed on CreditWatch for possible downgrade other securities , including the double-B-minus\/B rating of Crossland 's certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes .
10114	Open it and two soulful eyes on a boy 's brown face peer out from the page , pleadingly .
10117	No , but he 's endangered all the same : His new sitcom on ABC needs a following to stay on the air .
10118	ABC has n't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years , and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate .
10120	So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign .
10126	`` The grapevine is n't organized , but you and I know it exists , '' says Mr. Carew , referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders .
10128	I want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show .
10129	I want white America to talk about it , too , but I 'm convinced that the grapevine is what 's happening . ''
10130	ABC says it is aware of the producers ' action , but the mailing was sent without the network 's blessing .
10132	Meanwhile , as the Sunday evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of `` Murder , She Wrote , '' the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed : The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings , but accolades are slow in coming .
10133	Doug Alligood , a black advertising executive who tracks black viewing patterns , gives the Carews an `` A '' for marketing moxie , but is n't alone in his lukewarm reaction .
10134	Some shows just do n't impress , he says , and this is one of them .
10135	TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. said it plans to shift its headquarters to Calgary , Alberta , from Toronto next year to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural-gas industry .
10136	Gerald Maier , president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern , said the company 's future growth is `` increasingly linked '' to decisions made by Calgary-based gas producers .
10137	`` Since deregulation of the market in 1985 , producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing , '' Mr. Maier said . ``
10140	That includes all the gas consumed in Ontario and Quebec , along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the
10142	`` Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships , '' Mr. Litvinchuk said . ``
10143	Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it , it helps to have input and access to transportation companies . ''
10144	The move , which could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 42.5 million -RRB- in relocation and severance payments , should be complete by next summer , Mr. Maier said .
10146	The company will save between C$ 4 million and C$ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary , Mr. Maier added .
10147	Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it .
10149	Since its founding in 1818 , Brooks Brothers , the standard-bearer of the Ivy League look , has eschewed flashy sales promotions and fashion trends -- the rules that most retailers live by .
10150	But with sales growth sluggish and other men 's stores putting on the heat , the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a smug attitude .
10151	So two weeks ago , thousands of Brooks Brothers charge customers -- customers conditioned to wait for twice-yearly clearance sales -- got a surprise : an invitation to come in and buy any one item for 25 % off .
10152	During the four-day promotion , shoppers at the Short Hills , N.J. , store lined up to pay for big-ticket items like coats and suits .
10154	Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat , Brooks Brothers is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan , `` The Surprise of Brooks Brothers . ''
10156	The message is loud and clear : This is not your father 's Brooks Brothers .
10160	Brooks Brothers hopes that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise .
10161	`` We have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their -LCB- job -RCB- interview suit here , '' says William Roberti , chairman and chief executive officer of Brooks Brothers . ``
10168	Many clothiers , especially Ralph Lauren , have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated Ivy League and English styles .
10169	In keeping with men 's broader fashion scope today , businessmen are dabbling in English and Italian suits that are conservative but not stodgy .
10170	The rigid Ivy League customer , Brooks Brothers ' bread and butter , meanwhile is becoming extinct .
10171	Thus , Brooks Brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as Paul Stuart , Barneys New York and Louis , Boston .
10175	Fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant strides in its women 's business , given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline .
10179	Despite these challenges , Marks & Spencer sees big potential in Brooks Brothers , noting the widely recognized name and global presence .
10181	Brooks Brothers says business is robust at its 30 outlets in Japan and two shops in Hong Kong .
10183	Alan Smith , president of Marks & Spencer North America and Far East , says that Brooks Brothers ' focus is to boost sales by broadening its merchandise assortment while keeping its `` traditional emphasis . ''
10184	The British parent is also streamlining : Brooks Brothers , which continues to make almost all of its merchandise , recently shut one of its two shirt plants in Paterson , N.J. , and has closed boys ' departments in all but 20 stores .
10187	With newly installed escalators , the store retains its signature wood-and-brass look but is less intimidating .
10188	More shirts and sweaters will be laid out on tables , instead of sitting behind glass cases , so that customers can `` walk up and touch them , '' Mr. Roberti says .
10190	The entire second floor of its Madison Avenue store is now casual sportswear featuring items such as ski sweaters , leather backpacks and a $ 42 wool baseball hat with the store 's crest .
10191	The centerpiece of the overhaul , according to Mr. Roberti , is the men 's tailored clothing department , where Brooks Brothers has added new suit styles and fabrics .
10192	`` The perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit , '' Mr. Roberti says , referring to Brooks Brothers ' signature three-button `` sack suit , '' with a center-vented jacket and boxy fit .
10193	But it now offers more two-button versions and suits with a tapered fit .
10198	The maker of chemical and industrial materials did n't say how much it would pay or when it would make the transactions .
10203	Arthur Price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of MTM Entertainment Inc. , a Los Angeles production company that has fallen on hard times .
10204	Mr. Price , 61 years old , also stepped down from the board of TVS Entertainment PLC , the British TV company that last year bought MTM , producer of such TV programs as `` Hill Street Blues '' and `` The Mary Tyler Moore Show . ''
10208	Mr. Price `` wanted to run the MTM business '' and may have regretted selling the company to TVS , suggested Charles Denton , managing director of Zenith Productions , a subsidiary of Carlton Communications PLC , London .
10209	Mr. Gatward declined to comment , and Mr. Price could n't be reached on Friday .
10210	In the TVS statement , Mr. Price said `` leaving MTM was a very difficult decision , '' but added that `` it is now time for a change ... . ''
10214	In that announcement , TVS also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new U.S. sales manager .
10215	Mr. Gatward has spent a lot of time since late September at MTM 's headquarters ; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives , according to the TVS spokesman .
10219	The market for reruns sold to local U.S. broadcasters has been weak for the past three or four seasons .
10220	Mr. Price co-founded MTM in 1969 with U.S. actress Mary Tyler Moore and Grant Tinker , her then-husband .
10225	Institut Merieux S.A. , which offered 942 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 801.2 million -RRB- , or C$ 37 a share for Connaught , said it would extend its bid , due to expire last Thursday , to Nov. 6 .
10226	A C$ 30-a-share bid by Ciba-Geigy Ltd. , a pharmaceutical company based in Basel , Switzerland , and California-based Chiron Corp. , a bioresearch concern , was extended to Nov. 16 .
10229	Merieux , a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in Lyon , France , is controlled 50.1 % by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A .
10230	The Canadian government previously said Merieux 's bid did n't offer enough `` net benefit '' to Canada to be approved , and gave Merieux an until mid-November to submit additional information .
10232	Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught 's shares outstanding .
10233	Institut Merieux , which already holds a 12.5 % stake in Connaught , said that at the close of business Thursday , 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C$ 44.3 million face amount of debentures , convertible into 1,826,596 common shares , had been tendered to its offer .
10234	At the close of business Thursday , Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer .
10237	In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught , the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a C 415 million research accord , `` It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits -LCB- of the case -RCB- at this time . ''
10239	The university had sought an injunction blocking Connaught 's board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by Merieux .
10244	Centerior Energy Corp. said the Ohio Water Development Authority approved terms for two series of tax-exempt bonds to finance a water-pollution control and solid-waste disposal facilities .
10249	General Motors Corp. 's GMC Truck division put a $ 750 cash incentive on its 1990 full-sized Jimmy and Suburban trucks .
10251	After days of intense but fruitless negotiations , a federal judge last week threatened to convert William Herbert Hunt 's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation .
10252	Judge Harold C. Abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks .
10255	While admitting such a move would be `` devastating '' to most creditors , Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form .
10259	Despite his reluctance to take the latter step , the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Minpeco S.A. , a minerals concern owned by the Peruvian governmemt .
10260	The Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit , which is seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan , has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of Minpeco , which won a $ 132 million judgment against Mr. Hunt , his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in
10261	While claiming that penalties , legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $ 250 million , Minpeco has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $ 65.7 million .
10264	Despite long private sessions in both New York and Dallas , the two sides ended the week `` 6,000 miles and many dollars apart , '' according to attorney Hugh Ray , who represents Manufacturers Hanover .
10265	Meanwhile , inside the courtroom , the judge said he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $ 50 every time they referred to each other with terms such as `` liar '' or `` slime . ''
10266	All three major creditors -- the IRS , Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover -- voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by Mr. Hunt .
10267	A reorganization plan proposed jointly by the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover was stalled by a negative vote from Minpeco .
10268	The mineral concern 's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover .
10269	Neither plan is dead , however , and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the Minpeco-Manufacturers Hanover dispute .
10270	Meanwhile , settlement negotiations continue between Mr. Hunt and the IRS , which has already reached a tentative agreement with Nelson Bunker Hunt .
10274	Terms have n't been finalized , but the transaction is expected to close by year end , Pacific First said .
10277	Pacific First owns Pacific First Federal Savings Banks and other financial services firms .
10278	General Electric Co. 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $ 178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp. , 74%-owned by Leucadia , the sellers said .
10279	The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services , Chicago , a major owner of railway equipment and part of the GE Capital operations .
10290	Dow Jones & Co. extended its tender offer of $ 18 a share , or about $ 576 million , for the 33 % of Telerate Inc. that it does n't already own until 5 p.m. EST , Nov. 6 .
10293	The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched the offer on Sept. 26 , but it does n't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date .
10295	In the tender offer supplement , Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20 % growth rate `` as a hoped-for goal '' of Telerate 's management `` and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company 's likely future performance . ''
10299	Late last week , representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer , but those talks did n't result in any changes in the offer .
10301	Dow Jones , which owns 67 % of Telerate , publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases .
10305	Air & Water , which provides environmental services and systems , paid about 1.4 million of its shares for Falcon .
10309	Sows for breeding and bred gilts totaled 1,070,000 , down 2 % from a year ago .
10310	-LRB- Jacksonville , Fla. -RRB- -- Charles Bates , president , chief executive and chief operating officer will resign from these positions and the board effective Oct. 31 .
10312	Roger L. Sutton , executive vice president , was appointed as the new president and chief operating officer .
10313	Kerry P. Charlet will become executive vice president , and retain his positions as chief financial officer and treasurer .
10315	Concord New Horizons Corp. , creators of a 1988 movie called Nam Angels , used the gang 's name and trademarks without authorization , the not-for-profit corporation says in a complaint filed in federal court .
10318	Also named in the suit is Media Home Entertainment Inc. of Culver City , Calif. , its parent , Heron Communications Inc. , and Broadstar Television of Los Angeles , holders of the copyright on the movie .
10319	A Concord spokeswoman called the suit `` unfounded '' but declined to comment further .
10320	Besides being upset with the film 's use of the Hells Angels name and logos , the Angels are angry with their depiction in the movie .
10321	`` There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the Hells Angels in this movie , '' said George Christie , president of the club 's Ventura chapter .
10322	`` Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust . ''
10323	Nam Angels shows Angels fighting with each other and also depicts them as showing no remorse when a member is killed .
10325	Hells Angels was formed in 1948 and incorporated in 1966 .
10327	Douglas H. Miller , self-employed in the oil and gas securities business , was named chairman of this oil and gas exploration company , filling a vacancy .
10328	Mr. Miller , who has been a Coda director , also was named chief executive officer , succeeding Ted Eubank , who remains president and chief operating officer .
10329	Lawrence M. Gressette Jr. , president , was elected to the additional posts of chairman and chief executive officer of this utility holding company , effective Feb. 1 , 1990 .
10330	The 57-year-old Mr. Gressette , who was also elected chairman and chief executive of all Scana subsidiaries , succeeds John A. Warren .
10333	Seats on the Amex currently are quoted at $ 151,000 bid and $ 200,000 asked .
10343	The sky filled with 12.8-pound shells , several of which fell back to Earth , destroying homes and buildings .
10344	When the smoke cleared , six people were dead -LRB- three from heart attacks -RRB- , and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at .
10345	Mr. Good , who documents these things as best he can , provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt : `` 1,430 pounds of ammunition , '' he wrote his commander in chief , were expended on `` unidentified aircraft , '' flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet .
10346	Well , thousands of Californians on the scene insisted the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large , hardy UFO , but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings .
10347	One thing 's for sure : There have been a ton of them , and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest .
10349	I think we owe it to the American people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject . ''
10350	Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise : `` If I become president , I 'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public , and the scientists .
10354	Still , despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone , the visitors do seem to keep coming and , like the recent sightings , there 's often a detail or two that suggests they may actually be a little on the dumb side .
10355	For instance , witnesses in Voronezh say the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend , after strolling around the city park , left behind some rocks .
10363	Maybe some of our talk-show hosts and anchors have already been taken over ?
10365	Another guy who thinks they 're out there and closing fast is Whitley Strieber , whose new novel , `` Majestic '' -LRB- Putnam , 317 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , takes a look at a reported 1947 UFO crash near the Roswell Army Air Field in a New Mexico desert .
10367	He even had sex with one -- sort of , and not intentionally -- as readers learned in his `` Communion '' -LRB- a book recently described in the New York Times as a `` nonfiction best seller '' -RRB- .
10369	The apparent crash became top secret , and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings .
10376	Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company 's sales , led to huge losses and left Akzo 's survival in doubt .
10380	Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants , Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders -LRB- $ 1.88 billion -RRB- on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance .
10382	The fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20 % of Akzo 's sales .
10392	The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990 , up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988 .
10394	For example , Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations , is small in plastics and does n't make fertilizers .
10395	Thus , while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics , it has less to fear from the current slump .
10398	A decline may come in the first half of 1990 , he said , but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn .
10399	To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles , Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals , which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals .
10402	Akzo also makes products derived from salt , such as chlorine and caustic soda .
10404	But Akzo is still slimming down : It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany .
10405	Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak , Akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses , such carbon fibers and aramid , extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests .
10408	Sales growth of 10 % a year seems possible , he said , and Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990 .
10409	Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints , auto finishes and industrial coatings .
10410	In August , for example , it completed the $ 110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc. , a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood , metals and plastics , from Tyler Corp .
10411	Mr. Bergsma said Akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale .
10413	Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan .
10415	Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic drugs and veterinary products .
10419	He is a politician with the courage of true conviction , as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40 % .
10420	But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing , especially if it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved .
10423	British politicians divide into two groups of chickens , those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling .
10424	So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher .
10425	The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps .
10429	This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President Bush , as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the Federal Reserve and the Mulford Treasury .
10431	He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System .
10433	To make matters even more confusing , the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson 's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling .
10434	They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows .
10437	At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound .
10439	Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS .
10446	We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson 's resignation , and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy , John Major .
10448	In pursuit of this mystery , Keynesian adepts and twin-deficit mavens need not apply .
10452	Inflation is easier to spark and harder to control .
10457	Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .
10459	In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial , for example , and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate .
10466	We would add that in political terms , Mrs. Thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser .
10467	In the end , neither policy was followed , and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery .
10474	What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen .
10475	They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy , that is to say , stagflation .
10477	Our advice is this : Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money -LRB- which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do -RRB- .
10478	This was the version of supply-side economics that , in the late 1970s and early '80s , worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today .
10483	Surrounded by stacks of paper , two computers and photos of himself boating and flying , Mr. Phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency .
10484	First and foremost , Mr. Phillips said he hopes to improve client service .
10488	He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to , such as Lever Brothers , American Express and Seagram .
10490	`` Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month , but two or three times a week , '' he said .
10491	Mr. Phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the WPP takeover .
10492	The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising , public relations and design all in one place , or `` Ogilvy Orchestration '' in Ogilvyspeak -- a reality .
10494	`` There is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there is no single focus , '' Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March , when the reorganization was announced .
10495	Now Mr. Phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including American Express , American Telephone & Telegraph and Ryder -- by year 's end .
10496	Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task .
10498	Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year .
10501	As Mr. Dougherty says , `` The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia , as we call it . ''
10502	Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .
10504	Mr. Roman , by contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at Ogilvy 's Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` lame duck . ''
10505	Mr. Phillips said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable , given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new New York headquarters .
10508	Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff , closed the executive dining room and , after the takeover , let go half a dozen financial executives .
10509	WPP , which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy 's new headquarters building to outsiders .
10512	Arthur Klein , president of Young & Rubicam 's New York office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven , Conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 .
10513	In an internal memo , Alex Kroll , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense .
10516	Mr. Klein will work with Mr. Kroll on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending .
10519	Wells , Rich , Greene named Cheryl Heller as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group , which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising .
10522	She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients , including Reebok and Apple .
10524	As previously reported , the account is troubled , with Philip Morris asking Backer Spielvogel Bates , Ogilvy & Mather , and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work .
10535	Sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of I. Magnin , Bullock 's , and Bullocks Wilshire .
10539	The company 's earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation , which bondholders use a measurement of the chain 's ability to pay its existing debt , increased 11 % in fiscal 1989 to $ 926.1 million from $ 833.6 million .
10541	Excluding those businesses , earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation for 1988 would have been $ 728.5 million .
10543	Altogether , Macy and its subsidiaries own or lease 149 department stores and 61 specialty stores nationwide .
10546	This includes $ 4.6 billion of long-term debt , $ 457.5 million in short-term debt , and $ 95.7 million of the current portion of long-term debt .
10548	While our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes , we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want . ''
10549	Mr. Finkelstein is apparently referring to B. Altman and Bonwit Teller , two New York retailers that have recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled Campeau Corp .
10551	Other retail properties for sale include Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field , retailers now owned by B.A.T PLC , the British tobacco conglomerate .
10553	Mr. Finkelstein flew to San Francisco the day after the earthquake , and found that 10 to 12 of his company 's stores had sustained some damage , including the breakage of most windows at the I. Magnin store on Union Square .
10554	`` The volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive , but looking at the whole fiscal year , we do n't see the effect as material , '' wrote Mr. Finkelstein .
10555	RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A. 's Nestle Foods unit for $ 370 million .
10556	The sale , at a higher price than some analysts had expected , helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts Nestle 's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to about 12 % .
10560	Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit .
10563	Louis Gerstner Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR , called the sale a `` significant step '' in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a `` a strategic divestiture . ''
10566	`` RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses , '' Mr. Gerstner said Friday .
10567	Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S. , but RJR 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 % .
10568	Nestle 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc. , which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively .
10574	Aetna Life & Casualty Co. 's third-quarter net income fell 22 % to $ 182.6 million , or $ 1.63 a share , reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions .
10576	Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million , when net was $ 235.5 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
10579	But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly , the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results .
10582	Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30 % to $ 59 million , reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for nearly three years .
10584	Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ 48 million , which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit .
10585	In the nine months , net rose 4.3 % to $ 525.8 million or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 504.2 million , or $ 4.41 a share , last year .
10587	Here , at a soccer stadium near the black township of Soweto yesterday , were eight leaders of the African National Congress , seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
10589	Here was the state security appartus poised to pounce on any words or acts of provocation , let alone revolution .
10590	But the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace , unity , negotiation and discipline .
10591	`` We stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow , '' said Walter Sisulu , the ANC 's former secretary general who , along with five of his colleagues , served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago .
10594	The government and the ANC , the bitterest of enemies , are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table .
10595	Pretoria releases the ANC leaders , most of whom were serving life sentences , and allows them to speak freely , hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence .
10596	The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation , emphasizing discipline , hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps , such as freeing Nelson Mandela , the most prominent ANC figure , and unbanning the organization .
10597	The government of President F.W. de Klerk is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions .
10598	Meanwhile , the many organizations inside the country that back the ANC are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency , which has severely curtailed black opposition , remains in force .
10599	The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening .
10602	In a message read out at the rally , exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo , who ca n't legally be quoted in South Africa , said the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk `` may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country '' if he chooses a `` path of genuine political settlement . ''
10603	Still , this does n't mean that either the government or the ANC is changing stripes -- or that either has moved significantly closer to the other .
10604	The government may ease repression in some areas , but it still keeps a tight grip in others .
10605	For instance , it releases Mr. Sisulu without conditions , yet his son , Zwelakhe , a newspaper editor , is restricted to his home much of the day and is n't allowed to work as a journalist .
10607	Speakers yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against Pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation , known as apartheid .
10609	Because the ANC remains banned , both the government , which approved the rally , and the organizers , who orchestrated it , denied it was an ANC rally .
10613	Behind them was a huge ANC flag and an even bigger sign that said `` ANC Lives , ANC Leads . ''
10615	In the stands , people waved ANC flags , wore ANC T-shirts , sang ANC songs and chanted ANC slogans .
10617	As a police helicopter circled overhead , Mr. Sisulu repeated the ANC 's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations : Release all political prisoners unconditionally ; lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations ; remove all troops from the black townships ; end the state of emergency , and cease all political trials and political executions .
10624	But now Westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers .
10627	Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities , and Westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years .
10629	`` Westinghouse 's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner , '' says Russell L. Leavitt , of Salomon Brothers Inc .
10631	Already this year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp. , among others .
10635	Westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co .
10636	`` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier , '' says Theodore Stern , executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group .
10637	At the same time , Westinghouse hopes its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the U.S. , from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG , Siemens AG , and British General Electric Co .
10638	Under the agreement , Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment .
10640	In addition , the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology , such as the plants ordered by Florida Power , and even utilize each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations .
10641	`` Even though we 'll still compete against Mitsubishi , we can also work jointly on some projects , and we 'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility , '' Mr. Stern contends .
10644	It is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which , unlike utilities , are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants .
10646	Despite shutdowns of the company 's Lester and East Pittsburgh plants , the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in North Carolina .
10647	Still , Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity .
10650	John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development .
10657	By Richterian standards , the show that the Oakland Athletics put on Friday and Saturday nights , in putting a mercifully swift end to the game 's Longest Short Series , rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11 .
10658	The boys with the white elephants on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much , but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs .
10659	The Pale Pachyderms propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the San Francisco Giants .
10660	Combined with their two pre-quake victories , way back on Oct. 14 and 15 -LRB- the scores were 5-0 and 5-1 , remember ? -RRB- , that gave them a sweep of the best-of-seven series .
10662	That 's geologically correct , but a trifle unfair otherwise .
10663	They showed up , but did n't -- or could n't -- challenge .
10664	They led for nary an inning in the four games , and managed to stir their fans only once .
10665	That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when , trailing 8-2 , they scored four times and brought their big heat -- Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell -- to the plate with one out and a runner on .
10666	But Clark flied out to short right field and Mitchell 's drive to left was caught on the warning track by Rickey Henderson as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one .
10667	`` I went out to Todd -LCB- Burns , the A 's reliever -RCB- and told him that we were n't gon na let this guy beat us , '' said Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach of the decisive confrontation with Mitchell , the National League 's reigning home-run king .
10668	`` I told him to make Mitchell reach for everything , and that 's what we did .
10671	But if the A 's had n't won in four , they would have prevailed in five , or six , or seven .
10674	The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10 .
10676	That list includes last season 's champs , the Los Angeles Dodgers , who rode a miracle home run by Kirk Gibson and two faultless pitching performances by Orel Hershiser to a five-game triumph over a bewitched , bothered Oakland crew .
10678	They led the Major Leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals .
10682	Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four-game set , and their nine home runs tied one .
10684	Rickey Henderson , the do-everything leadoff man , had nine hits and set or tied four-game Series marks for triples -LRB- 2 -RRB- and stolen bases -LRB- 3 -RRB- .
10685	The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire , their regular-season leader with 33 , and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt .
10688	He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One , and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake .
10690	One was that , despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News , he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due .
10691	The other is that he 's an Oakland native , and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas last week .
10693	`` Give me four or five more Series with these guys , and I do n't care if I ever win a Cy Young , '' he said , in reference to baseball 's best-pitcher award .
10698	It was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous , `` big market '' teams to monopolize the best talent , but quite the opposite has occurred : Twelve different clubs have won titles in the 14 seasons since its advent .
10700	The rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can is clear : Your company will benefit in terms of market share , customer satisfaction and profitability .
10703	`` Most of us grew up believing in the axioms ` Haste makes waste ' and ` Do n't cut corners , ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed , '' says Dean Cassell , vice president for product integrity at Grumman Corp .
10704	`` But in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off .
10706	Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations .
10707	Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed , and shift some responsibility for analyzing , improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees .
10711	The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery , so couriers can be on the road by 8:35 .
10712	No customer is present at the morning package sort , but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction .
10715	Following a problem-solving formula used by teams throughout Federal Express , members of the Natick team monitored their morning routine , carefully noting where and when the work group 's resources were used effectively and where they were idle , waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way .
10718	`` We used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good . ''
10719	The team even created a points system to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most to reduce package-sort cycle time .
10725	`` The team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering , scheduling and purchasing personnel , '' reports Alan Westendorf , director of quality .
10728	The Tonawanda team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line .
10734	The team was composed of representatives from engineering , manufacturing , corporate estimating , flight test , material , quality control , and other departments .
10736	`` But instead of gathering their input piecemeal , we formed the team , which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved . ''
10737	Armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information , each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal , submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule .
10738	`` We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly , because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team , '' Mr. Anton explains .
10741	The result was a more thoughtful , complete and competitive proposal , '' Mr. Anton concludes .
10742	The successes achieved at Federal Express , Union Carbide and Grumman suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage .
10743	Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction .
10745	And they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work .
10747	Home taping of pre-recorded music cuts into record industry revenues , but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more .
10748	That 's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the Office of Technology Assessment at the request of the House and Senate judiciary committees .
10752	The longstanding position of the Recording Industry Association of America , a trade group based in Washington , D.C. , is that record companies , performers , songwriters and music publishers need to be remunerated by government-imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping .
10753	`` I think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal , '' says Gary Shapiro , vice president for government and legal affairs of the Electronic Industries Association in Washington .
10754	`` What -LCB- the report -RCB- shows is everything we 've been saying for the past eight or nine years -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry .
10756	Trish Heimers , a spokesperson for RIAA says her organization has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment .
10757	A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape , or DAT , recorder sold in the U.S. have a built-in device that restricts its ability to make second copies from DAT tape copies of digital compact disks .
10758	But the disappointing sales of DAT machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal wrangling that went into the agreement .
10759	Under current copyright laws , it is considered `` fair use '' to reproduce copyrighted material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's family or friends , while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited .
10760	A survey contained in the 291-page report , `` Copyright and Home Copying : Technology Challenges the Law , '' found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a `` right '' -- a right , moreover , that was exercised by 40 % of Americans over the age of 10 in the past year .
10762	Reports by the Office of Technology Assessment do n't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that Congress may pursue .
10763	The study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes `` an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology , '' and says that finding an `` appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision , not a technical one .
10766	And in little more than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire .
10768	His latest coup : September 's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc -LRB- $ 3.07 billion -RRB- merger between Adia S.A. , the world 's second-largest temporary employment agency , and Inspectorate International S.A. , a Rey-controlled product-inspection company .
10770	But approval is almost certain since Mr. Rey and a friendly Adia management are in control .
10772	This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs .
10773	Mr. Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982 , building up the little-known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions .
10775	Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake Geneva and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps .
10781	In short : Rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets . ''
10782	However , the Swiss financial press in general , as well as many analysts , have had a hard time making up their minds about Mr. Rey and his un-Swiss ways .
10786	Looking into Bally , he could hardly believe what he saw : a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs ; it had 7,000 employees .
10787	Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife , Mr. Rey acquired 20 % of Bally 's shares .
10788	But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976 , and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain .
10797	With the nonferrous metals business undermined in Switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs , this looked like a dull undertaking .
10803	They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad .
10804	In 1987 , Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland 's Jean Frey AG , a major producer of magazines and newspapers .
10807	Meanwhile , as such strategic investments have mounted , the merchant-banking arm of Mr. Rey 's Omni Holding has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies , often after a financial or corporate restructuring .
10808	Today , this branch of Mr. Rey 's empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions , placement of securities and real estate .
10809	In its portfolio are such diverse companies as United Kingdom-based Air Europe ; Checkrobot Inc. , a U.S. company that makes supermarket checkout machines ; Norment Industries , a U.S. manufacturer of securities systems ; Com Systems Inc. , a U.S. regional telephone company ; and major real-estate projects in the U.S. and Europe .
10811	`` Companies move in and out , '' says Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment .
10814	The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled Harpener 's small shareholders , but analysts say it makes sense for Inspectorate-Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help .
10818	He says he wants to `` influence '' but not `` manage '' companies .
10819	`` I do n't want to be like -LCB- financier Alan -RCB- Bond and the other Australians .
10823	Ultimate expects the 3 1\/2-year agreement to generate $ 100 million in sales , but it would n't estimate profit .
10826	In the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year , Boeing Co. said it will create a Defense and Space Group to consolidate several divisions .
10827	Meanwhile , Boeing officials and representatives of the Machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the month-old strike that has shut the aerospace giant 's assembly lines at a time when it has an $ 80 billion backlog of jetliner orders .
10830	Boeing has said repeatedly it wo n't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer is n't good enough .
10832	About 1,000 strikers signed petitions last week calling for Boeing and Machinists representatives to schedule new meetings .
10835	In May , the company consolidated its Aerospace and Electronics groups ; the new Defense and Space Group will contain the Aerospace and Electronics division and Advanced Systems , both based in the Seattle area ; Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia ; Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita , Kan. , and ArgoSystems in Sunnyvale , Calif .
10836	B. Dan Pinick , president of Boeing Aerospace and Electronics , will become president of the new group , which will become operational Jan. 2 .
10837	In addition , Boeing said it also will reorganize all its work in Wichita into military and commercial divisions .
10838	All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations , Boeing said .
10845	Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to Poland and Hungary , according to U.S. officials who attended the talks .
10846	The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members , especially France , West Germany and Italy , to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools , which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members .
10847	For several years some European countries have complained that outdated Cocom lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security .
10848	Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for Hungary and Poland as they move toward more democratic rule , just as special treatment had been agreed on for China .
10850	They added that `` all of us -LRB- Cocom members -RRB- look at the changes in Hungary and Poland in a positive way , but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study . ''
10851	The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating China as a special case , despite the recent repression of dissent there , but to offer no further concessions .
10852	The U.S. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , all the Cocom members agreed on `` the continuing need for this organization , '' which was founded 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War .
10853	The officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward `` streamlining '' Cocom 's restricted products list , and to improve procedures for punishing companies that do n't comply with the export restrictions .
10854	The officials said this meeting `` put in motion '' procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions , but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter .
10855	Unisys Corp. 's announcement Friday of a $ 648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year .
10856	At the same time , the sheer size of the loss , coupled with a slowing of orders , made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern .
10859	`` The quarter was terrible , and the future looks anything but encouraging . ''
10871	That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines .
10873	Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization .
10876	He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards .
10878	He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down .
10880	`` We 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through , '' Mr. Unruh said .
10881	`` The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business , and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company .
10885	But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months , compared with earnings a year earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share fully diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion .
10889	Mr. Weil of Weil & Associates said he will remain at $ 1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk .
10890	`` The break-even point for next year is much lower , but is it low enough ? '' he asked .
10894	Mr. Straszheim expects he will take some heat , and he 's right .
10897	The forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988 , Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds .
10899	The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40 % to 45 % and later to 55 % .
10902	Now , in fact , he is predicting economic growth of 2.9 % this year and 2.1 % next year , a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter .
10904	While such changes might sound minor , they are n't : Merrill Lynch manages or oversees some $ 300 billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities .
10905	Two well-known colleagues who believe Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling , both of whom run their own New York research firms .
10909	Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy .
10913	Pestered by bosses , brokers , clients and media people and pushed by their own egos , Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator .
10932	One of Mr. Straszheim 's recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white .
10939	He says the economy , and especially the employment numbers , look much better than he expected ; interest rates have generally declined ; inflation has n't run amok .
10945	You make a forecast , and then you become its prisoner . ''
10946	It is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast , and Mr. Straszheim is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip .
10947	His approach to the recantation is direct but low-key .
10948	`` For some time , we had forecast negative third - and fourth-quarter growth .
10950	Crane Co. said it holds an 8.9 % stake in Milton Roy Corp. , an analytical-instruments maker , and may seek control of the company .
10951	Crane , a maker of engineered products for aerospace , construction , defense and other uses , made the disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing .
10952	In the filing , Crane said that in the past it considered seeking control of Milton Roy , of St. Petersburg , Fla. , through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time .
10959	Thermo Electron acquired some 6 % of Milton Roy 's common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early September .
10960	Gabelli Group began raising its Milton Roy stake in July , and holds 14.6 % , according to a recent SEC filing .
10962	Earlier this month , Milton Roy signed a letter of intent to acquire Automated Custom Systems Inc. , Orange , Calif. , and its sister operation , Environmental Testing Co. , in Aurora , Colo .
10964	Under the terms , Milton Roy will pay an initial $ 4 million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses .
10965	In the nine months , Milton Roy earned $ 6.6 million , or $ 1.18 a share , on sales of $ 94.3 million .
10968	The opposition Labor Party leader , Neil Kinnock , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class , denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet .
10971	Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark .
10972	Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy .
10973	As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to gold or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining .
10976	As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued .
10978	To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % .
10979	This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls .
10980	Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .
10982	The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .
10985	When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency .
10987	Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship .
10988	The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit .
10991	Consequently , Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row .
10998	This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle .
11001	This policy is totally mindless , and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies .
11002	Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany .
11005	The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate .
11008	Joseph P. Jordan , 52 years old , becomes president , chief executive officer and a director of the bank company .
11009	Mr. Jordan , formerly president and chief executive of Fishkill National Bank in Beacon , N.Y. , succeeds Donald Broderick , who died at 52 in an automobile accident .
11013	At the same time , personal income was held down by the effects of Hurricane Hugo , which tore through parts of North and South Carolina in late September .
11014	The department said personal income rose 0.3 % in September to a $ 4.469 trillion rate but would have climbed 0.6 % had it not been for the storm .
11016	The figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled U.S. economic expansion in the third quarter while -- on an inflation-adjusted basis -- business investment slowed , government spending declined , and exports were flat .
11022	In August , personal income rose 0.3 % and spending grew 0.9 % .
11038	`` I 'm not saying everything is hunky-dory , but we have completed the transition , '' Robert M. Price , chairman and chief executive , said in an interview .
11046	Mr. Perlman , who is also acting chief financial officer and the odds-on favorite to become the next chief executive , said the company is achieving `` modest positive cash flow from operations , and we expect that to continue into 1990 . ''
11050	Loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test .
11051	Last week Control Data reported third-quarter earnings of $ 9.8 million , or 23 cents a share , on revenue of $ 763 million .
11053	While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company 's Ticketron unit -- Mr. Price said future restructuring would be a question of strategy .
11056	Rather , Mr. Perlman said , Control Data intends to bid for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas , where `` there is great interest in games of skill . ''
11058	Control Data 's semiconductor business , VTC Inc. , continues to lose money , the executives acknowledged , but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it .
11059	The company 's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses .
11062	James E. Ousley , computer products group president , said such arrangements could help slash Control Data 's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990 .
11068	Control Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users , such as the scientific , engineering and academic communities .
11072	But while its stock is selling at about half Control Data 's estimated breakup value , neither Messrs. Perlman nor Price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover .
11075	Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years , I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil ; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing .
11076	Perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists , suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are `` whacky '' and referring to so many citizens as `` la-la activists . ''
11077	Strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists who seek to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste .
11078	While there are no easy low-cost solutions , simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state , the nation and the world .
11079	If nothing else , such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action .
11082	I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about California and its environmental movement , but picking Frank Lloyd Wright to say it for you was a bad call .
11091	Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers ' comments in letters to the editor , `` Alar : Scaring on the Side of Caution . ''
11092	The illogic and inaccuracy of John H. Adams 's comments for the National Resources Defense Council fully justifies your characterization of California 's Greens in particular as `` la-la activists . ''
11093	We may all hope that California 's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university 's renowned Prof. Tom Jukes provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their `` wealthy Hollywood weepers . ''
11094	I have a different approach to offer , not only to Californians , but to all Americans .
11095	In a free country , the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety .
11100	Revenue last year increased by more than 11 % over 1988 , and net income nearly tripled from restated year-earlier net of $ 900 million .
11101	The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate , rising demand for air travel and improved average yield -LRB- revenue received per ton of traffic transported a kilometer -RRB- .
11104	The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry .
11106	The newspaper quoted KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed , the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue .
11107	Mr. Kryuchkov was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th Directorate a new unit would work `` to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country . ''
11108	Czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of `` massive buying out of food '' by tourists from Poland , Hungary and the Soviet Union , the Rude Pravo daily said .
11109	Rising inflation in Poland and Hungary makes Czechoslovak food , clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries .
11110	The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market .
11111	West Germany 's biggest union , IG Metall , said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation 's automotive , steel and engineering industries .
11117	The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by Italy to help preserve the fabled city of canals .
11121	Intermoda will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the Quelle catalog , translated into Russian , to Soviet customers who have access to convertible currency .
11123	Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged EC producers ' profits and led to job losses , the commission imposed a duty of 10.2 % on TVs made by Daewoo , a duty of 12.3 % on Goldstar Co. , 13 % on Samsung and 19.6 % on TVs made by other South Korean producers .
11124	The commission said that EC television producers lost `` important market shares '' and suffered an `` unsustainable '' pressure on prices because of the Korean companies ' marketing and pricing policies , which it said were `` in clear violation '' of international trade rules .
11125	In other news concerning South Korea 's television industry , Samsung signed an agreement with Soyuz , the external-trade organization of the Soviet Union , to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the Soviet Union .
11126	South Korea and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year .
11127	Sri Lanka , where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil , said it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year .
11128	`` Many programs we have now come from the West and are not suitable to our culture , '' a government minister said .
11131	Broad Inc. said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common , and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock , payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6 .
11132	The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad , Inc. , which spun off its home-building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc .
11137	Shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairmen , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the chance to run Columbia .
11140	In affidavits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against Sony for hiring the two producers , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story .
11142	In the affidavits , Mr. Peters says he was `` shocked '' when Mr. Ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them .
11143	Mr. Peters claims he reminded Mr. Ross that Robert Daly and Terry Semel , the top executives of the Warner Brothers studio , had `` repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept '' an offer such as Sony 's .
11144	In response , Mr. Peters says , Mr. Ross referred to his colleagues at Warner with an `` obscenity '' and said : `` Tell them that they do n't have a job .
11146	Warner denies Mr. Ross ever said any such thing , and , in fact , denies virtually everything Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits .
11150	But they also make it clear that the first thing a judge will have to decide is which , if any , version of events in this morass is fiction , and which fact .
11152	Warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations , but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired .
11155	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do n't have much to gain from a protracted battle .
11156	Sony , for its part , could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high , choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia , although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
11157	In that case , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially , but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner .
11158	At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers , but other murkier issues will play a big role .
11159	Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up .
11160	Warner denies such an agreement was made , and disputes the Guber-Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter .
11162	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner , notably the Sylvester Stallone film `` Tango and Cash . ''
11163	Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that Warner was `` taking over '' the picture , and another producer would be giving all of the orders .
11164	Over his objections , Mr. Peters says , the film 's release date was moved up `` by many months '' to December , and plans for a soundtrack `` worth millions of dollars '' were dropped .
11166	Mr. de la Bouillaire says Warner Brothers production president Mark Canton called him Oct. 19 and said Mr. Peters is `` off the picture .
11168	The editor also says the new producer on the film , Bruce Baird , told editors to screen the picture without telling stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell or Mr. Peters .
11170	If someone asks , just lie and tell them it will be done , '' Mr. de la Bouillaire says Mr. Baird told them .
11173	He says Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber , as the contractual producers with consultation rights , have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film .
11174	Dozens of Guber-Peters staffers are still working on the Warner lot and consulting on various projects on a `` daily basis , '' the attorney says .
11175	Mr. Guber , in his affidavit , says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25 , Mr. Semel `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company . ''
11176	Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988 , when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy part of MGM\/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio .
11177	Mr. Guber says he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel .
11179	Mr. Semel , in his affidavit , does n't mention any hugging or congratulating .
11180	He says he told Mr. Guber he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner . ''
11181	He said he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly and that , in a conference call , the three agreed they could n't let the producers out of their contract .
11182	Mr. Ross , in his own affidavit , says he and Mr. Daly instructed Mr. Semel to tell the producers Warner would n't terminate their agreement .
11183	Mr. Guber says that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said Mr. Ross was `` crazy because of the Time deal , '' meaning , Mr. Guber says , that Mr. Ross `` did not want to communicate to his new merger partner , Time Inc. , that Warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances . ''
11184	Mr. Guber also says in his affidavit that Mr. Daly `` told us that even if Sony did not want us , Warner 's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged , that there was no way ` to put the egg together , ' and that it would sue Sony for tons of money . ''
11188	Some in Hollywood suggest Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took encouragement from Warner studio executives such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally .
11189	According to this theory , Warner executives , hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers , encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company .
11191	Mr. Rabinowitz , the Warner attorney , says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract .
11194	For example , he says that since 1985 , he and Mr. Peters have developed over 85 movie projects , and Warner has `` passed '' or chosen not to produce at least 76 .
11196	E.W. Scripps Co. said it has acquired a Georgia cable television company and a Massachusetts publishing firm .
11199	The system is still under construction and will serve a market of 7,600 homes .
11200	The company also has acquired Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc. , a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in Littleton , Mass .
11203	`` I suppose you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up , '' he said , `` but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not . ''
11204	The federal deficit was $ 155.15 billion in 1988 and $ 149.69 billion in 1987 .
11210	The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year .
11217	The Treasury marked up its forecast by $ 17 million in July , but that proved to be about $ 5 billion too optimistic .
11220	The increase reflects spending on the S&L rescue as well as payroll and Social Security checks normally issued in October that were issued in September this year because Oct. 1 fell on a Sunday .
11223	Consumers Power Co. , now the main unit of CMS Energy , ran into financial problems over its $ 4.2 billion Midland nuclear plant , which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs .
11227	The company suffered a loss of $ 270 million in 1985 , but its financial situation has been improving since then .
11228	Humana Inc. said it expects to receive about $ 27 million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute .
11239	It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen . ``
11241	Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail , because unlike Sansui , which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges , most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held .
11244	If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers .
11245	Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of Sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour .
11247	But in recent years , the market has moved toward less expensive `` mini-component '' sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other .
11248	Some of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp. , responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players .
11249	Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .
11255	`` Attitudes -LCB- toward being acquired -RCB- are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , '' Mr. Murasawa said .
11257	Whether Polly Peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen , but at the news conference , Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around .
11258	Sansui , he said , is a perfect fit for Polly Peck 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an `` original equipment maker '' basis for sale under other companies ' brand names .
11259	He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui 's product line , using Sansui 's engineers to design the new products , and will move Sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck 's own factories .
11260	`` Whatever capital it -LRB- Sansui -RRB- needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world , that capital will be injected , '' Mr. Nadir said .
11261	And while Polly Peck is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui , it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer .
11263	He took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980 .
11267	The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. , the rival suitor for LIN .
11268	Moreover , the amended pact shows how McCaw 's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner , forcing huge debt on the proposed new company .
11270	The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations .
11272	LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend , but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained .
11277	`` We 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to , '' acknowledged Michael Plouf , LIN 's vice president and treasurer .
11278	Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt , he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later .
11289	Under its revised proposal , Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50 % interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt .
11294	To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer .
11305	William O. McCoy , president of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter .
11307	For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .
11308	Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a share , or $ 1.9 billion , but now those estimates are being scaled back .
11312	Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw , in an attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984 .
11318	Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index .
11325	Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market .
11327	Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising .
11330	Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody , in addition to Shearson , do program-trade OTC stocks .
11331	Shearson , Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers , however .
11333	Of course , there were sell programs in past years , too , but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days .
11334	That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash , when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled .
11338	In such an environment , market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares .
11342	No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks . ''
11346	The OTC stocks in the S&P 500 include Nasdaq 's biggest , such as Apple Computer , MCI Communications , Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne .
11349	The problem , market makers say , is that while the industrial average and the S&P 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in , the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind .
11350	Eight trading days after Oct. 12 , the day before the stock market plunge , for instance , the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 4.3 % , compared with 3.3 % for the S&P 500 , 3.5 % for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6 % for the industrial average .
11352	Three days later , as of Friday 's close , the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 % , compared with 5.9 % for the industrial average , 5.7 % for the S&P 500 and 5.8 % for the Big Board Composite .
11356	The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.39 , or 1.2 % to 452.76 on Friday .
11358	Weakness in big technology stocks hurt the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index , which fell 1.4 % , or 6.43 , on Friday , to 437.68 .
11359	The Nasdaq Financial Index lost about 1 % , or 3.95 , to 448.80 .
11362	LIN Broadcasting surged 4 5\/8 to 112 5\/8 ; LIN and BellSouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications .
11367	The semiconductor concern said the interruption in shipment of its 80486 computer chip will be brief and have little impact on the company 's earnings .
11376	London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down .
11377	London shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in New York and by the drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson 's resignation .
11378	It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling , but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading , and signs of further weakness in the British pound , proved a hefty load to bear .
11380	The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1 , down 4.5 % from the previous Friday and 6.8 % from Oct. 13 , when Wall Street 's plunge helped spark the current weakness in London .
11382	Volume was 840.8 million shares , up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week 's most active session .
11383	Dealers said the turnover , largely confined to the 100-share index stocks , partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account .
11384	But they said Friday 's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain 's currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's cabinet .
11385	A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas , the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded , was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson 's departure and Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet shuffle .
11386	He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain 's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization .
11388	Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson 's successor , John Major , had only been in the job one day .
11393	Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues , Imperial Chemical Industries dropped 11 to # 10.86 , Hanson skidded 9.5 to 200.5 , and British Telecom fell 10 to 250 .
11394	In Tokyo , stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading .
11395	The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29 .
11399	An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday .
11402	Fund managers said Friday 's profittaking was a natural result of the week 's `` abnormal fever '' in buying real estate , shipbuilding , steel and construction shares .
11403	Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday , the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4 % .
11406	Traders said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest .
11412	That 's leaving small investors with cold feet , they said , and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well , at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat .
11413	Elsewhere , share prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Amsterdam , Brussels and Stockholm , and were mixed in Milan .
11415	Share prices also closed lower in Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Manila , Wellington and Seoul .

11423	More than 70,000 people filled a soccer stadium on the outskirts of the black township of Soweto and welcomed freed leaders of the outlawed African National Congress .
11425	Walter Sisulu , the ANC 's former secretary general who served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago , urged peace , negotiation and discipline .
11426	President de Klerk 's government permitted the rally , and security forces did n't interfere .
11427	Pretoria 's approval of the demonstration and the ANC 's conciliatory tone appeared aimed at setting up negotiations to give blacks political rights .
11434	With all the votes counted , a government spokesman said Prime Minister Gonzalez 's party won 176 seats in the 350-seat Cortes , or lower house of parliament .
11436	Thousands of East Germans attended public rallies organized by the Communist leadership and demanded free speech , controls on the security forces and an end to official privileges .
11437	The gatherings in East Berlin and elsewhere were viewed as part of a government effort to stop activists from staging protests to press their demands .
11439	More than 10,000 demonstrators had called for free elections and the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes .
11444	U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases .
11445	The talks in New York are the first since Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze unveiled proposals in September to scrap existing weapons .
11447	The rebels also reportedly tightened a blockade on roads leading to the capital , and government forces shelled a guerrilla-held area in western Afghanistan .
11456	The West German machinery and plant equipment industry 's orders rose an inflation-adjusted 1 % in September from a year earlier despite a sharp drop in foreign orders , the German Association of Machinery Makers said .
11458	While domestic orders climbed an adjusted 8 % and a nominal 11 % in September , foreign orders declined 4 % after inflation and 1 % on a nominal basis .
11459	In the third quarter , orders rose a real 5 % and a nominal 9 % .
11460	Domestic orders were up a real 11 % and a nominal 14 % , while foreign orders rose a real 1 % and a nominal 5 % .
11465	Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously ; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions .
11466	First Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant , spent $ 2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden .
11469	That acquisition , to be completed by year end , will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines , making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets .
11470	It 's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring : P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear .
11471	Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics , there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry .
11474	Likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing .
11476	Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives .
11477	Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year , and since most products can be easily copied by competitors , they 're loath to test them with consumers .
11478	`` Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it does n't mean they are packaged goods , '' says Leonard Lauder , chief executive of Estee Lauder .
11480	In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits .
11483	Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field .
11488	P&G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin .
11492	Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals .
11499	The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics .
11501	Instead , they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases .
11502	Estee Lauder , for example , spends only an estimated 5 % of sales on advertising in the U.S. , and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy .
11504	Nearly 70 % of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets , according to Andrew Shore , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
11506	As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase .
11509	Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products .
11511	Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics .
11515	But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business .
11516	In the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies .
11523	Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned , careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important .
11524	And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $ 15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own .
11525	There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad .
11526	After years of mistrust born of Watergate , past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Iran-Contra scandal , President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities .
11527	If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years .
11528	Over the past week , the president has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
11530	Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so .
11531	Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban .
11534	It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the CIA did n't get back in the assassination game .
11535	`` We 've finally been able to convince them that Casey and -LCB- Oliver -RCB- North do n't work here anymore , '' says one administration official .
11536	The new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .
11538	The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult .
11541	Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla . -RRB- and Vice Chairman William Cohen -LRB- R. , Maine -RRB- , for their part , angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. Noriega .
11542	The White House got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities .
11543	Instead , Mr. Bush and his aides made it clear they respected Congress 's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. Boren and the moderate Mr. Cohen to iron out their differences .
11545	Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the White House , and that the committee had given Mr. Bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years .
11553	At the same time , some congressional liberals will accuse Sens. Boren and Cohen of wimping out , and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales .
11554	But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities , the country could be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards , while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky Congress will balk .
11555	Several of the New York Stock Exchange 's own listed companies , led by giant Contel Corp. , are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it .
11556	Claiming program trading has turned the Big Board into a `` gambling casino , '' Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance .
11558	The group will complain to Washington , to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself , he said .
11559	`` They should call -LCB- the exchange -RCB- Trump East , '' charged Mr. Wohlstetter , the 79-year-old founder of Contel who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader .
11561	to help some scavengers or schemers , or help corporate America ? ''
11562	Contel is a $ 6 billion telephone and electronics company .
11564	The market 's Friday-the-13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and the Big Board 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange .
11566	Mr. Wohlstetter , for example , said he wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190-point Dow plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what I get back is gobbledygook . ''
11571	Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash .
11575	It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade .
11581	The Big Board ca n't ban stock-index futures , of course , but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off .
11583	Contel 's Mr. Wohlstetter said the group of Big Board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort , and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public .
11585	Among those Mr. Wohlstetter said he has been talking to are Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp. , which is the parent of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. ; GTE Corp. 's James Johnson , and ITT Corp. 's Rand Araskog .
11590	Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services unit said it cut off Bear Stearns , Morgan Stanley , Oppenheimer and General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. unit .
11598	As the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and reshufflings , the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies .
11599	The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again .
11602	It sounds like the work of a decade , but the deadline is late 1991 , when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election .
11604	She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit .
11608	Last week , the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up : Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters , the adviser , announced his resignation within an hour .
11610	Currency traders , suspecting Mr. Major wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark .
11614	Economists have been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought .
11617	Recovery could be hampered if Britain 's major trading partners in Europe , which are enjoying robust economic activity , cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991 .
11622	There 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community .
11624	At a June EC summit , Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership , saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements .
11628	Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue .
11629	Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership .
11630	Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates .
11637	Over the weekend , she said she did n't intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian .

11654	Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18 .
11655	The women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did .
11656	Not unexpectedly , wives , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80 % of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two-thirds of housecleaning , washing dishes , child care and family paper work .
11657	Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half .
11658	But the researchers found that while children 's household tasks eased the mother 's burden appreciably , the husband 's helping hand `` appears to lighten the children 's load almost on a one-for-one basis and to reduce the wife 's responsibility only modestly . ''
11663	Her share decreases , but only slightly . ''
11666	State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills .
11668	But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
11671	About one-third pay out of their own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare , private insurers or the Veterans Administration .
11673	The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution , however , that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration , and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays .
11674	Moreover , they note , those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes , using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives .
11676	THE REAGAN generation young men and women reaching political maturity during Ronald Reagan 's presidency -- are firmly liberal on race and gender , according to NORC , the social science research center at the University of Chicago .
11678	NORC 's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-Reagan and pro-Republican than other adults .
11679	But , says chief investigator Tom Smith , this `` does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues . ''
11680	Answers to a dozen questions in the 1986 , 1987 , 1988 and 1989 national surveys reveal that men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the 18 to 24 year olds in NORC 's polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s .
11681	They were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys .
11683	That compares with 58 % of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55 % in the 1972 through 1975 surveys .
11684	Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better suited to politics than women , 70 % of the Reagan generation disagreed , compared with under 60 % of younger men and women in the earlier years .

11732	Federal Reserve critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies .
11733	They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt .
11738	After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small .
11743	A `` senior Fed official '' spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times , saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed .
11744	The statement angered Chairman Greenspan , but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets .
11748	Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . ''
11755	In fact , the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds , fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market 's jitters .
11760	Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch .
11766	So far , Mr. Greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well .
11768	`` We 've gotten through two stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems , '' says David Hale , an economist of Kemper Financial Services .
11775	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
11776	ECI Environmental Inc. , initial offering of 1.1 million shares , of which ECI will sell 990,000 and co-founders will sell 110,000 shares , via Oppenheimer & Co .
11777	Fastenal Co. , proposed offering of 400,000 common shares by holders , via Robert W. Baird & Co. and William Blair & Co .
11779	Industrial Funding Corp. , initial offering of common stock , via Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. and Piper Jaffray & Hopwood .

11782	Spencer J. Volk , president and chief operating officer of this consumer and industrial products company , was elected a director .
11786	But even on the federal bench , specialization is creeping in , and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court .
11789	There , judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable .
11792	But the Reagan administration thought otherwise , and so may the Bush administration .
11794	Now only three of the 12 judges -- Pauline Newman , Chief Judge Howard T. Markey , 68 , and Giles Rich , 85 -- have patent-law backgrounds .
11795	The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman , 73 , are approaching senior status or retirement .
11796	Three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years , so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court .
11797	Several organizations , including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association , have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds .
11798	The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training .
11804	The Justice Department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court , Judge H. Robert Mayer , a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago .
11805	`` I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law , '' Judge Mayer says , adding that `` it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers -LRB- who argue before the court -RRB- to make us understand -LRB- complex patent litigation -RRB- . ''
11809	If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic 's favor , the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices , color and food additives and all other non-drug products that required Food & Drug Administration approval .
11810	Lisa Raines , a lawyer and director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnical Association , contends that a judge well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise .
11811	And Judge Newman , a former patent lawyer , wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court , `` The panel 's judicial legislation has affected an important high-technological industry , without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest . ''
11814	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
11850	Only a few months ago , the 124-year-old securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown , racked by internal squabbles and defections .
11852	Chief executives and presidents had come and gone .
11856	And that means 42-year-old Michael Carpenter , president and chief executive since January , will for the first time take complete control of Kidder and try to make good on some grandiose plans .
11859	Through the first nine months of the year , Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds , with a 2.8 % market share , up slightly from 2.5 % in the year-earlier period , according to Securities Data Co .
11869	More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since January .
11870	The firm 's brokerage force has been trimmed and its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people .
11872	One of GE 's goals when it bought 80 % of Kidder in 1986 was to take advantage of `` syngeries '' between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp. , GE 's corporate-finance unit , which has $ 42 billion in assets .
11874	So far , instead of teaming up , GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered .
11875	Yet , says Mr. Carpenter , `` We 've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody . ''
11879	Still , without many actual deals to show off , Kidder is left to stress that it finally has `` a team '' in place , and that everyone works harder .
11881	`` We are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past , '' says Scott C. Newquist , Kidder 's head of investment banking since June .
11884	The firm 's new head of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. Newquist , B.J. Megargel , talks of the opportunity to `` rebuild a franchise '' at Kidder .
11885	`` The Kidder name is one of only six or seven that every CEO recognizes as a viable alternative '' when considering a merger deal , he says .
11887	With investment banking as Kidder 's `` lead business , '' where do Kidder 's 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in ?
11888	Mr. Carpenter this month sold off Kidder 's eight brokerage offices in Florida and Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch & Co. , refueling speculation that Kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely .
11891	The result : Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies , much closer to the clientele of Goldman , Sachs & Co. than a serve-the-world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
11894	They will get `` new and improved tools to sell , particularly to the affluent investor , '' says brokerage chief Charles V. Sheehan .
11896	However , skeptics caution that this kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper , but does n't always happen .
11900	Mr. Cathcart , who will return to the Quaker Oats Co. board of directors , in addition to his personal ventures , is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling Kidder .
11903	`` It was an absolutely marvelous line and one I used many times , '' he says .
11910	Taiwan 's USI Far East Corp. , a petrochemical company , initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker , according to Alson Lee , who heads the Philippine company set up to build and operate the complex .
11915	The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives , polypropylene and polyethylene .
11919	It also is considered critical to the country 's efforts to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities .
11920	The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade .
11923	The legislator , Enrique Garcia , had actively backed the plant , but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila .
11924	The country 's Supreme Court dismissed the suit , but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration .
11926	However , at a news conference Thursday , Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site , adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province .
11927	`` We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them , but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province , '' Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents .
11931	He said USI Far East has applied to both the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank 's International Finance Corp. for financing that could include equity stakes .

11942	President Bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs .
11948	Rather , it 's a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress , fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business .
11949	President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president .
11951	White House spokesmen last week said Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power , exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right .
11955	White House aides know it 's a step that ca n't be taken lightly -- and for that reason , the president may back down from launching a test case this year .
11956	Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming , Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress .
11958	Still , Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto .
11960	White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea , but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it .
11961	Mr. Bush , former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process .
11966	They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . ''
11967	This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills .
11968	Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan. -RRB- , for one , accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush `` to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional . ''
11969	There 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved .
11970	`` It 's a major issue , and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level , '' says Stephen Glazier , a New York attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto .
11976	If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
11979	Big chunks of the government budget , like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare , would n't be affected .
11984	Whatever the outcome of a test case , President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would `` antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans , '' says Louis Fisher , a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who specializes in executive-legislative relations .
11989	`` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . ''
12000	Analysts say much of Kellogg 's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes , Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes , which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume .
12002	`` Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg 's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats , '' says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire .
12008	People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that 's ` healthy ' for you -- oats , bran . ''
12013	The company has five other U.S. plants , including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100 , which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year .
12018	A company spokesman said it was `` possible , but highly unlikely , '' that the plant might never be built .
12019	`` As we regain our leadership level where we have been , and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity , we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan , '' he said .
12020	The new facility was to have been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant , and Kellogg 's largest construction project .
12025	Last Friday 's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company 's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic .
12026	Until recently , Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50 % share of market , measured in dollar volume .
12027	Although he called current market conditions `` highly competitive , '' Mr. LaMothe , Kellogg 's chairman and chief executive officer , forecast an earnings increase for the full year .
12028	Last year , the company earned $ 480.4 million , or $ 3.90 a share , on sales of $ 4.3 billion .
12030	Net fell 16 % to $ 123.1 million , or $ 1.02 a share , from $ 145.7 million , or $ 1.18 a share .
12034	PARKER HANNIFIN Corp. , which is selling three automotive replacement parts divisions , said it will retain its Automotive Connectors and Cliff Impact divisions .
12036	The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
12039	Rated single-B-1 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-B-plus by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Goldman , Sachs & Co .
12042	Rated single-A-3 by Moody 's and triple-B by S&P , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
12045	The Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation , following Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin 's long-awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties .
12049	The finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries .
12050	Rather , the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years , with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims .
12056	Istat said the statistics are provisional and are n't seasonally adjusted .
12059	Import values are calculated on a cost , insurance and freight -LRB- c.i.f . -RRB- basis , while exports are accounted for on a free-on-board -LRB- f.o.b . -RRB- basis .
12060	As competition heats up in Spain 's crowded bank market , Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities .
12062	The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in Banco Exterior .
12063	The government directly owns 51.4 % and Factorex , a financial services company , holds 8.42 % .
12066	Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market conditions turn sour .
12067	If that proves true , analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992 , when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers .
12068	With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor .
12069	Mr. Luzon and his team , however , say they are n't interested in a merger .
12074	At the same time , many of Spain 's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth .
12076	The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .
12078	Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes .
12079	But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
12084	The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad .
12085	To strengthen its capital base , Banco Exterior this year issued $ 105 million in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors .
12087	Last year 's drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15 % surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies .
12090	The bank says it 's interested in purchasing banks in Morocco , Portugal and Puerto Rico .
12095	The bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges .
12097	Harry J. Pearce , named general counsel in May 1987 , says the reduction is a cost-cutting measure and an effort to let the No. 1 auto maker 's 134-lawyer in-house legal department take on matters it is better equipped and trained to handle .
12102	Among the types of cases the in-house litigators handle are disputes involving companies doing business with GM and product-related actions , including one in which a driver is suing GM for damages resulting from an accident .
12106	Mr. Pearce says law firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with GM will be those providing the highest-quality service at the best cost -- echoing similar directives from GM 's auto operations to suppliers .
12108	Mr. Pearce has shaken up GM 's legal staff by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions , including a special-projects group that has made films on safety and drunk driving .
12113	The study covered 11 major U.S. attorneys ' offices -- including those in Manhattan and Brooklyn , N.Y. , and New Jersey -- from 1980 to 1987 .
12118	In 1980 , the study says , prosecutors surveyed filed charges against 25 defendants for each 100,000 people aged 18 years and older .
12124	The study is to provide reporters , academic experts and others raw data on which to base further inquiries .
12127	Mrs. Marcos and her late husband , former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos , were charged with embezzling more than $ 100 million from that country and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real estate in Manhattan .
12130	The office also said Mrs. Marcos and her husband were n't brought to the U.S. against their will after Mr. Marcos was ousted as president .
12131	The prosecutor quoted statements from the Marcoses in which they said they were in this country at the invitation of President Reagan and that they were enjoying the hospitality of the U.S. .
12134	The indictment , which was sealed and apparently forgotten by investigators until 1987 , charges Mr. Koskotas and three others with tax fraud and other violations .
12135	He made numerous trips to the U.S. in the early 1980s , but was n't arrested until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then-Vice President George Bush at a government function .
12142	`` We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester , who headed the bar 's pro bono study committee .
12143	DALLAS AND HOUSTON law firms merge : Jackson & Walker , a 130-lawyer firm in Dallas and Datson & Scofield , a 70-lawyer firm in Houston said they have agreed in principle to merge .
12145	The merger must be formally approved by the partners of both firms but is expected to be completed by year end .
12146	Jackson & Walker has an office in Fort Worth , Texas , and Dotson & Scofield has an office in New Orleans .
12150	He seeks damages from the company 's 15 directors on grounds that they either `` participated in or condoned the illegal acts ... or utterly failed to carry out their duties as directors . ''
12151	GE is defending itself against government criminal charges of fraud and false claims in connection with a logistics-computer contract for the Army .
12155	`` It is a cheap-shot suit -- procedurally defective and thoroughly fallacious -- which was hurriedly filed by a contingency-fee lawyer as a result of newspaper reports , '' said a GE spokeswoman .
12156	She added that the company was considering bringing sanctions against Mr. Greenfield for making `` grossly inaccurate and unsupported allegations .
12159	Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . ''
12161	But Mr. Tonkin said dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory .
12162	His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit , where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders .
12164	Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. representatives criticized Mr. Tonkin 's plan as unworkable .
12165	It `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a Chrysler spokesman said .
12167	The tentative settlement between Gulf Power , a Pensacola , Fla. , electric company , and federal prosecutors would mark the end of one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co. in the past year .
12170	The individuals said Gulf Power and federal prosecutors are considering a settlement under which the company would plead guilty to two felony charges and pay fines totaling between $ 500,000 and $ 1.5 million .
12174	No employee or vendor would be involved .
12175	A spokesman for Southern Co. would say only that discussions are continuing between Gulf Power and federal prosecutors .
12179	While Southern Co. has been reluctant to discuss the grand jury investigations , Edward L. Addison , chief executive officer , has said the company is prepared to defend its tax and acccounting practices if any charges are brought against it .
12180	Morever , Mr. Addison has said Southern Co. and its units do n't condone illegal political contributions .
12181	Neither Mr. Addison nor any other Southern Co. official has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the current inquiries .
12182	The probe of Southern Co. has attracted considerable attention this year because of several events that have befallen the company , including the death of a Gulf Power executive in a plane crash and the disappearance of a company vendor who was to be a key grand jury witness .
12186	Investigators have been trying to determine whether the crash was an accident , sabotage or suicide .
12190	The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation , but issued a stinging response that called Exxon a `` corporate pariah '' that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists .
12191	The federation , with 5.8 million members nationwide , has been one of the sharpest critics of Exxon 's handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly ignoring requests to meet and discuss it .
12192	The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along Alaska 's southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry .
12193	Exxon 's Exxon USA unit was one of the charter members of the Corporate Conservation Council , a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the National Wildlife Federation to foster `` frank and open discussions '' between industry and the federation 's leaders .
12194	In a letter to the federation , Raymond Campion , Exxon 's environmental coordinator , said : `` Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness . ''
12197	The banking company said it reached an agreement in principle with International Business Machines Corp. on a systems operations contract calling for IBM to operate First Tennessee 's computer and telecommunications functions .
12198	Further , under the agreement , First Tennesse would continue to develop the software that creates customer products and sevices .
12199	`` Because personal computers will soon be on the desks of all of our tellers , and customer service and loan representatives , information will be instantly available to help customers with product decisions and provide them with information about their accounts , '' according to John Kelley , executive vice president and corporate services group manager at First Tennessee .
12201	First Tennessee , assisted by IBM , said it will attempt to place the employees within the company , IBM or other companies in Memphis .
12205	In its report to Congress on international economic policies , the Treasury said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade , known as the current account , `` is likely at best to be very modest , '' and `` the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year can not be excluded . ''
12209	`` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates .
12221	Rep. Jamie Whitten of Mississippi and chairman of House Appropriations turned a $ 20 million Bush request for his state into a $ 49.7 million bequest .
12228	The agreement was announced by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Friday , as President Bush and other leaders from the Western Hemisphere gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy .
12229	Costa Rica had been negotiating with the U.S. and other banks for three years , but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting .
12231	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement `` an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy , '' noting that it will `` when implemented , provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by Costa Rica . ''
12234	The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to provide approximately $ 180 million to help support the deal , and additional funds are expected from Japan .
12237	The bills will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 ,
12239	Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
12241	The 13-week and 27-week bills will be issued tomorrow rather than Thursday , Nov. 2 , as originally planned .
12242	The three-month bills will still mature Feb. 1 , 1990 , and the six-month bills on May 3 , 1990 .
12243	The Treasury also said noncompetitive tenders will be considered timely if postmarked no later than Sunday , Oct. 29 , and received no later than tomorrow .
12247	American Pioneer , parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank , said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company .
12248	Recently , the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares .
12250	The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies , including the insurance departments of the states of Florida and Indiana , the company said .
12255	But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo , strikes , and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments , economists said .
12257	But the important factory-jobs segment , which last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears , is most likely to be skewed by the month 's unusual events .
12258	Several other reports come before Friday 's jobs data , including : the September leading indicators index , new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow ; the October purchasing managers ' index and September construction spending and manufacturers ' orders on Wednesday ; and October chain-store sales on Thursday .
12262	What 's more , he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year are n't occurring at the same time as in the past , because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data .
12270	Economists said greatly increased consumer optimism , a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index .
12271	All orders-related components , such as consumer-goods orders and building permits , are thought to have been weaker .
12273	Usually , October `` is n't a very interesting month -LCB- for retail figures -RCB- because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents , '' he said .
12277	Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5 % from August levels , although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage .
12278	Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall , machine tool makers say , but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry .
12279	September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums , but remained 7.7 % below year-earlier levels , according to figures from NMTBA -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology .
12280	Domestic machine tool plants received $ 303 million of orders last month , up 33 % from August 's $ 227.1 million , but still below the $ 328.2 million of September 1988 , NMTBA said .
12288	`` September was one of the biggest order months in our history , '' says James R. Roberts , vice president , world-wide sales and marketing , for Giddings & Lewis Inc. , Fond du Lac , Wis .
12295	There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods .
12296	However , there 's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union 's military might .
12297	`` The Commerce Department says go , and the Defense Department says stop , '' complains one machine tool producer .
12298	If that controversy continues , U.S. machine tool makers say , West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe .
12299	September orders for machining centers , lathes , milling machines , grinders , boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled $ 192.9 million , down 28 % from $ 266.5 million a year earlier , but a 23 % increase from August 's $ 156.3 million , NMTBA said .
12300	Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $ 110.1 million , a 78 % rise from $ 61.7 million a year earlier and a 55 % gain from $ 70.9 million in August .
12301	Today 's presses are large and costly machines , and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that does n't necessarily indicate a trend .
12302	Machine tool shipments last month were $ 281.2 million , a 24 % rise from a year earlier and a 25 % increase from August .
12312	`` When they talk mega-issues , they 're truly talking mega , '' says S.A. Dave , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India .
12323	The Indian stock markets have been on a five-year high , with dips and corrections , since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi started liberalizing industry .
12329	Convertible debentures -- bonds that can later be converted into equity shares -- are the most popular instrument this year , though many companies are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares .
12330	These mega-issues are being propelled by two factors , economic and political .
12331	In the past , the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills , petrochemical plants , car factories and other industrial concerns to conserve resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make .
12334	He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale .
12336	India 's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded , but they have started to think big .
12337	Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi 's policy , and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past .
12340	Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November , and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party will lose .
12341	Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi 's , and possibly more restrictive .
12343	No one admits to anything , but India 's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations .
12347	Larsen & Toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month ; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed .
12348	Still to come are big issues by Bindal Agro Chem Ltd. , a petrochemical and agrochemical company , and Usha Rectifier Corp . -LRB- India -RRB- , a semiconductor maker .
12351	Says M.J. Pherwani , chairman of the Unit Trust of India : The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before . ''
12352	But with growth come growing pains , and never has this been clearer on the Indian capital market than now .
12354	Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much ; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans .
12355	The government has been content with this far-reaching , subtle form of control , exercised on a case-by-case basis with no clear rules or guidelines .
12356	But now , with large amounts being raised from investors , the government 's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect .
12357	The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year , along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , but New Delhi has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational .
12358	Mr. Dave , its head , acts cheery and patient , but he makes no bones about the need to get to work .
12359	`` Mega or non-mega , we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved , '' he says .
12367	The media has raised questions about Larsen & Toubro 's issue , pointing out that it exceeds the company 's annual sales and its market capitalization .
12374	Mr. Patel agrees : `` There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds .
12375	They 're trying to plug the various loopholes , but they 're totally unprepared for this . ''
12376	Because of the large amounts of money being raised , the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used , some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes , which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of 1986 .
12380	Lion Nathan Ltd. , a New Zealand brewing and retail concern , said Friday that Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. is `` committed '' to a transaction whereby Lion Nathan would acquire 50 % of Bond 's Australian brewing assets .
12385	Bond Corp. , a brewing , property , media and resources company , is selling many of its assets to reduce its debts .
12386	`` Lion Nathan has a concluded contract with Bond and Bell Resources , '' said Douglas Myers , chief executive of Lion Nathan .
12387	Finnair , Finland 's state-owned airline , joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with archrival Scandinavian Airlines System .
12388	Under the accord , Finnair agreed to coordinate flights , marketing and other functions with SAS , the 50%-state-owned airline of Denmark , Norway and Sweden .
12389	The pact also calls for coordination between Finnair and Switzerland 's national carrier , Swissair , with which SAS entered a similar alliance last month .
12390	Finnair and SAS said they plan to swap stakes in each other .
12394	General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of Jaguar PLC , as GM got early clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to boost its stake in the British luxury car maker .
12396	Ford got a similar go-ahead earlier in October , and on Friday , Jaguar announced that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker had raised its stake to 13.2 % , or 24.2 million shares , from 12.4 % earlier in the week .
12398	In late trading Friday , Jaguar shares bucked the downward tide in London 's stock market and rose five pence to 725 pence -LRB- $ 11.44 -RRB- .
12404	With the golden share as protection , Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford 's overtures , and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM .
12405	Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar 's independence , but no deal has been announced .
12407	Analysts continued to speculate late last week that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder 's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990 .
12411	The GM agreement is expected to retain Jaguar 's independence by involving an eventual 30 % stake for the U.S. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures .
12412	Jaguar and GM hope to win Jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that would n't preclude a full Ford bid once the golden share expires .
12413	`` There 's either a minority -LCB- stake -RCB- package capable of getting Jaguar shareholder approval or there is n't , '' said one knowledgeable individual . ``
12431	Abbie lies back and leaves the frame empty .
12432	Of course that was n't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist , protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother .
12434	The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news .
12436	Ms. Chung 's program is just one of several network shows -LRB- and many more in syndication -RRB- that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events , using actors who are supposed to resemble real people , living and dead .
12442	But , as CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer puts it , the network now needs to `` broaden the horizons of nonfiction television , and that includes some experimentation . ''
12443	Since its premiere Sept. 16 , the show on which Ms. Chung appears has used an actor to portray the Rev. Vernon Johns , a civil-rights leader , and one to play a teenage drug dealer .
12445	On Oct. 21 , it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson , who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in Lebanon .
12446	The production had actors playing Mr. Anderson and former hostages David Jacobsen , the Rev. Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco .
12448	`` Prime Time Live , '' a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer , has a studio audience that applauds and that one night -LRB- to the embarrassment of the network -RRB- waved at the camera like the crowd on `` Let 's Make a Deal . ''
12449	-LRB- ABC stops short of using an `` applause '' sign and a comic to warm up the audience .
12451	NBC News has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by Sid Feders called `` Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , '' starring Maria Shriver , Chuck Scarborough and Mary Alice Williams , that also gives work to actors .
12455	The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated nonetheless .
12456	News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the networks ' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 for a one-hour program .
12459	That show , whose host is Ms. Chung 's husband , Maury Povich , has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case , the Rob Lowe tapes , what have you .
12460	Gerald Stone , the executive producer of `` A Current Affair , '' says , `` We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news . ''
12464	The network deals a lot with unknowns , including Scott Wentworth , who portrayed Mr. Anderson , and Bill Alton as Father Jenco , but the network has some big names to contend with , too .
12467	`` Saturday Night '' has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen-agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named Willie Bosket , who calls himself a `` monster '' and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in New York .
12469	That is n't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes , or even Connie Chung for that matter -LRB- who is paid $ 1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom `` Murphy Brown '' -RRB- .
12474	`` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' says Joe Sukle , the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown .
12475	`` They 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards .
12476	They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama . ''
12483	And some people do think that acting out scripts is n't worthy of CBS News , which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry .
12484	In his review of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' Tom Shales , the TV critic of the Washington Post and generally an admirer of CBS , wrote that while the show is `` impressive , ... one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take . ''
12485	Re-creating events has , in general , upset news traditionalists , including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank , former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , Joan Konner .
12486	Says she : `` Once you add dramatizations , it 's no longer news , it 's drama , and that has no place on a network news broadcast ... .
12489	Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man .
12492	`` This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie 's life , '' says Ms. Lawrenson , who has had an advance look at the 36-page script .
12495	It takes one person 's account and gives it authenticity . ''
12496	CBS News interviewed Jack Hoffman and his sister , Phyllis , as well as Mr. Hoffman 's landlord in Solebury Township , Pa .
12498	Mr. Silvers says , `` I wanted to be interviewed to get Abbie 's story out , and maybe talking about the illness will do some good . ''
12499	The executive producer of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' Andrew Lack , declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show , in particular .
12502	One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a `` work in progress , '' such as the Hoffman re-creation , but says CBS News is `` aware '' of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman 's former wife .
12504	Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed .
12505	The producers , he says , did a good job of depicting someone `` who had done so much , but who was also a manic-depressive .
12507	Last year , Dentsu started HDM , a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France .
12509	Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries , but they keep low profiles .
12510	Now , the giant marketing company , which holds 25 % of Japan 's 4.4 trillion yen -LRB- $ 30.96 billion -RRB- advertising industry , is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe .
12511	What is driving Dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe .
12514	Last year , Dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than 10 % of total billings , but the company is aiming at 20 % in the near future .
12516	For example , the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC .
12518	Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines , it is laying the groundwork for international growth .
12519	It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad .
12520	For the year ended March 31 , Dentsu sales rose 19 % to $ 8.9 billion from $ 7.5 billion , and net income jumped 59 % to $ 102 million from $ 64 million .
12530	Ciba Corning , which had been a 50-50 venture between Basel-based Ciba-Geigy and Corning , has annual sales of about $ 300 million , the announcement said .
12532	Ciba Corning makes clinical diagnostics systems and related products for the medical-care industry .
12533	The announcement said the acquisition should be completed by December after a definitive agreement is completed and regulatory approval is received .
12538	NBC 's comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2 % of homes , lagging behind the Jamie Lee Curtis comedy `` Anything But Love '' on ABC and CBS 's one-hour drama `` Jake and the Fatman . ''
12541	Proceeds will be used to reduce short-term debt at the beer and food concern , said Robert Vaux , vice president , finance .
12544	Mr. Vaux said that if no agreement is reached , other buyers will be sought by bid or auction .
12550	The announcements are scheduled to be made in Temple , Texas , and include a so-called `` notebook '' PC that weighs less than seven pounds , has a built-in hard disk drive and is powered by Intel Corp. 's 286 microprocessor .
12553	While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers , Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers .
12555	Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability .
12557	Now that is about to change , as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives .
12558	The laptops are not revolutionary and , indeed , are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp. , now a unit of Tandy Corp. , almost two years ago .
12559	But the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk , is more innovative .
12560	Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery , the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches , has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22 % larger than Compaq 's .
12561	Its keyboard , according to industry consultants , is better than Compaq 's , but its battery life of two to three hours is shorter .
12564	List prices on the heavier Texas Instrument laptops will be $ 4,999 for the TI Model 25 , with a 20 megabyte disk drive , and $ 5,599 for the 40-megabyte Model 45 .
12567	Shearson 's application is the first since the Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission announced June 21 that it would allow foreign brokerage firms to do business in that country .
12569	Under current rules , investors in Taiwan can buy overseas stocks only through the purchase of mutual funds issued by local and foreign investment trusts .
12571	A spokesman for Shearson said the brokerage service will be directed at individual investors who want to buy foreign and domestic stocks .
12573	Retailers in the West and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions .
12575	Sales increased a more modest 4.8 % in the South and 4.4 % in the Midwest .
12576	But sales in the oil-patch state of Texas surged 12.9 % and sales in South Carolina jumped 10.6 % in the period , the New York trade group said .
12579	`` There are a lot of have and have-not markets . ''
12581	The Northern California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the West and South Carolina .
12584	The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits .
12586	The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as Sears , Roebuck & Co. and K mart Corp. as well as closely held concerns such as R.H. Macy & Co .
12589	El Paso , Austin and Fort Worth , the three strongest retail markets in the nation , are all located in Texas , where employment grew a relatively strong 2 % .
12590	Massachusetts , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries , was the weakest link in bleak New England .
12592	In 1987 , the West had the slowest sales growth , and the South and the Midwest were first and second respectively , according to the council .
12593	Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo , they could see some benefits later on .
12595	Kerr-McGee Corp. said it will spend $ 42 million to purchase land and relocate its ammonium perchlorate storage facility to Clark County , Nev. , from Henderson , Nev .
12596	The company said it will move the storage and cross-blending operations to a site 23 miles northeast of Las Vegas to distance the operations from residential areas .
12597	Ammonium perchlorate is an oxidizer that is mixed with a propellant to make rocket fuel used in the space shuttle and military rockets .
12600	American Pacific and Kerr-McGee are the only two U.S. manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate .
12602	That prompted Kerr-McGee to consider moving the potentially volatile storage facilities and cross-blending operations away from town .
12603	Kerr-McGee said it has purchased 3,350 acres from the federal government in Clark County and plans to begin construction early next year .
12607	Elected as directors were Mr. Hollander , Frederick Ezekiel , Frederick Ross , Arthur B. Crozier and Rose Pothier .
12608	Removed from office were George Pratt , Robert E. Davis , Norman Gray , John Virtue , corporate secretary , and Barrett B. Weekes , chairman , president and chief executive officer .
12609	Newport officials did n't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier , Mr. Weekes had said Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team on the board .
12616	Bruce W. Wilkinson , president and chief executive officer , was named to the additional post of chairman of this architectural and design services concern .
12617	Mr. Wilkinson , 45 years old , succeeds Thomas A. Bullock , 66 , who is retiring as chairman but will continue as a director and chairman of the executive committee .
12618	Merger and acquisition activity in the third quarter exceeded the year-earlier pace , said Merrill Lynch & Co. 's W.T. Grimm & Co. unit in Schaumburg , Ill .
12625	Citing current stock market conditions and the trend away from highly leveraged transactions , Grimm said it was n't certain that the total value of transactions for the year will exceed the record $ 247 billion in 1988 .
12626	MEDICINE SHOPPE INTERNATIONAL Inc. declared a 3-for-2 stock split , and substantially boosted the dividend payout .
12630	NBI said that it has the funds to pay the dividend , but that it does n't have the surplus or profit required under Delaware law for payment of the dividend .
12632	Under terms of the stock , the Yukon ESOP can demand that the stock be redeemed for $ 4,090,000 on Nov. 30 , but NBI said it is legally prohibited from making the redemption .
12633	Failure to pay the dividend allows Yukon to convert all or some of its shares into NBI common after Nov. 30 , at a conversion price based on NBI 's closing stock price .
12635	NBI also said it has hired Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. as its financial adviser and investment banker to help it restructure financially and improve its balance sheet .
12636	Insurers may see claims resulting from the San Francisco earthquake totaling nearly $ 1 billion -- far less than the claims they face from Hurricane Hugo -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months .
12638	This estimate does n't include claims under workers ' compensation , life , health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges , highways and public buildings .
12639	The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $ 4 billion in claims that insurers face from Hurricane Hugo , which ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month .
12640	That 's because only about 30 % of California homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses .
12641	However , insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the Bay area earthquake , Hugo and last week 's explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co. 's refinery in Pasadena , Texas , will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump .
12644	Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first , analysts and brokers believe .
12645	`` The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters '' in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe , says Thomas Rosencrants , director of research at Interstate\/Johnson Lane Inc. in Atlanta .
12646	Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses .
12648	Insurers , such as Cigna Corp. , Transamerica Corp , and Aetna Life & Casualty Co. , buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd 's of London for one catastrophe at a time .
12649	After Hugo hit , many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year .
12650	After the earthquake two weeks ago , brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and Lloyd 's syndicates turned to the London market excess lines for protection of their own .
12651	James Snedeker , senior vice president of Gill & Roeser Inc. , a New York-based reinsurance broker , says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990 .
12652	However , companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat , or perhaps even decline slightly .
12655	But some large insurers , such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , do n't purchase reinsurance , but fund their own program .
12656	A few years ago , State Farm , the nation 's largest home insurer , stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure .
12657	The $ 472 million of losses State Farm expects from Hugo and an additional $ 300 million from the earthquake are less than 5 % of State Farm 's $ 16.7 billion total net worth .
12659	Transamerica expects an after-tax charge of less than $ 3 million against fourth-quarter net ; Hartford Insurance Group , a unit of ITT Corp. , expects a $ 15 million or 10 cents after-tax charge ; and Fireman 's Fund Corp. expects a charge of no more than $ 50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance .
12661	The consumer electronics , home appliances and information-processing concern said revenue in the six months ended Sept. 30 rose 8.9 % to 517.85 billion yen from 475.6 billion yen .
12662	Sales of information-processing products and electric parts increased a strong 22 % to 236.23 billion yen from 194.24 billion yen and accounted for 46 % of total sales .
12664	Sales of electric appliances were flat , and sales of electronic equipment declined slightly .
12668	The company said the debentures are being issued at an issue price of $ 849 for each $ 1,000 principal amount and are convertible at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of $ 25 a share .
12671	At the same time , shareholders approved the adoption of a rights plan and a super-majority voting approval requirement .
12672	They also approved the relocation of the company 's registered office to Toronto from Vancouver and a name change to NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd .
12673	Following the consolidation , the entertainment company , which has film and television operations in Beverly Hills , Calif. , will have about 4.1 million shares outstanding .
12676	The rights plan would be triggered if a person or group acquires 20 % or more of the common shares outstanding without making an offer to all shareholders .
12677	Under the super-majority amendment , certain mergers and other transactions would require approval of holders of 80 % of the company 's common shares outstanding .
12678	Wilfred American Educational Corp. said a federal grand jury in Boston indicted the operator of cosmetology and business schools for mail fraud .
12679	The charges in the 12-count indictment , which stem from events that allegedly occurred in late 1984 and early 1985 , involve enrollment procedures of six students and the preparation of certain reports , Wilfred said .
12681	Wilfred American said it will `` vigorously defend '' itself against the charges and added that the charges relate to procedures that it has since changed .
12682	Eight admissions representatives at two of Wilfred 's former Massachusetts schools previously pleaded guilty to charges of aiding , abetting and counseling students to submit false financial-aid applications .
12687	The group , led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman , Mr. Sugarman , owns about 45.2 % of Rally 's .
12688	In the Securities and Exchange Commission filings , the group has said it may seek control of Rally 's .
12689	Mr. Sugarman called the lawsuit `` not nice '' and said his group will continue to push for control of the company and the removal of certain directors .
12692	Rally 's also said it formed a committee of three directors , who are n't associated with either the Patterson or Sugarman groups , to analyze the situation .
12693	Leaseway Transportation Corp. said it will restructure $ 192.5 million of certain subordinated debentures to reduce its debt obligations and interest expense .
12695	Leaseway provides transportation services for manufacturers , distributors and retailers .
12696	Leaseway said it has begun discussions with certain institutional debt holders to review the proposed private placement transaction , which would exchange the debt for new subordinated debt instruments and equity securities .
12697	Specific terms are subject to review and a final agreement with debt holders , the company said .
12698	But the proposed transaction calls for an exchange of the debt for new debentures of lower face value and reduced cash interest .
12701	Company officials said Leaseway fulfilled payment requirements of its debt obligations since the leveraged buy-out , but `` our performance since the -LCB- buy-out -RCB- makes it imperative to implement actions that will further improve our cash flow .
12703	Lawmakers have n't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras , and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday , saying only that `` if there 's an all-out military offensive , that 's going to change the equation 180 degrees . ''
12706	The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America 's progress toward democracy in the region , attended by President Bush , Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders .
12710	He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels .
12712	Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates .
12714	The humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras , replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988 .
12716	Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan . -RRB- said yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his -LCB- Mr. Ortega 's -RCB- act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . ''
12718	While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question , rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration , Mr. Ortega 's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue .
12726	In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid , Mr. Ortega 's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections .
12731	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Petrie said that on Oct. 26 Petrie Stores agreed to purchase Mr. Petrie 's 2,331,100 Deb Shops shares .
12736	`` We did n't look at it and say , ` Oh my God , something is going to happen , ' '' said Stanley Uhr , vice president and corporate counsel .
12737	Mr. Uhr said that Mr. Petrie or his company have been accumulating Deb Shops stock for several years , each time issuing a similar regulatory statement .
12740	The Tokyo camera maker said net income more than doubled to 5.85 billion yen , or 16.08 a share , from 2.63 billion yen , or 7.24 yen a share .
12742	Increasing personal spending and capital investment are fueling growth , the company said .
12748	Pretax profit is expected to increase 18 % to 22 billion yen and net income is expected to rise 53 % to 10.5 billion yen .
12750	Presidio , a Denver oil and gas concern , said it will acquire the properties and operations of Home Petroleum Corp. , which includes two regional gas-gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of oil and 72 billion cubic feet of natural gas .
12751	Presidio said the properties are generally situated in Wyoming , North Dakota , Texas , Oklahoma and Louisiana .
12752	Gulf Canada , Calgary , said the transaction is part of its plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on Canada , Indonesia and other international areas .
12753	A spokesman for Gulf Canada , which is controlled by Toronto 's Reichmann family , said the properties account for about 6 % of the company 's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of oil and 35 million cubic feet of gas a day .
12754	He said Gulf Canada will likely report an extraordinary gain from the sale in the fourth quarter , but he would n't offer a specific estimate .
12756	NEC Corp. , a Tokyo-based computer and electronics concern , said net income rose 18 % to 29.66 billion yen -LRB- $ 208.7 million -RRB- in the fiscal first half , ended Sept. 30 , from 25.12 billion yen a year earlier .
12761	In the period just ended , computers accounted for 44 % of total sales , NEC said , and electrical devices made up 23 % .
12771	A unit of DPC Acquisition Partners launched a $ 10-a-share tender offer for the shares outstanding of Dataproducts Corp. , and said it would seek to liquidate the computer-printer maker `` as soon as possible , '' even if a merger is n't consummated .
12772	DPC Acquisition is controlled by Crescott Investment Associates , Wilson Investment Group , Kernel Corp. and Catalyst Partners .
12773	The investor group owns 1,534,600 Dataproducts common shares , or a 7.6 % stake .
12776	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , DPC Acquisition said it expects it will need about $ 215 million to buy the shares and pay related fees and expenses .
12777	DPC Acquisition added that it has not begun discussions with financing sources , and said it expected to repay the amounts borrowed through proceeds of the liquidation .
12778	Dataproducts officials declined to comment , and said they had not yet seen a suit filed in federal court by DPC Acquisition that seeks to nullify a standstill agreement between DPC Acquisition and Dataproducts .
12780	Dataproducts has since started a restructuring , and has said it is not for sale .
12781	Jayark Corp. agreed to pay $ 4 million in cash , $ 2 million of 12 % convertible debentures , and 1.6 million common shares to acquire closely held Kofcoh Imports Inc .
12784	Kofcoh is a New York holding company for Rosalco Inc. , which imports furniture and other items .
12785	David L. Koffman , president and chief executive officer of Jayark , holds about 40 % of Kofcoh , Jayark said .
12786	Jayark , New York , distributes and rents audio-visual equipment and prints promotional ads for retailers .
12791	Sales were higher in all of the company 's business categories , with the biggest growth coming in sales of foodstuffs such as margarine , coffee and frozen food , which rose 6.3 % .
12792	Oils and fats also did well , posting a 5.3 % sales increase .
12793	Sales in the category that includes pharmaceuticals , amino acids and chemicals rose 4.7 % .
12797	Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules .
12805	Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman , chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange .
12806	Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be `` responsive to the needs of the membership and the board . ''
12807	Mr. Thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has been executive vice president since March 1988 .
12808	He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel .
12810	Mr. Staloff , 44 , was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products .
12812	For the past two years , he said , he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract , seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market .
12815	The Merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil , gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York , and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
12817	Earlier this year , the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago exchanges .
12822	It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years .
12823	It also had both the fewest , and least experienced , investigators per million contracts traded .
12824	The Merc received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director , Kevin P. Conway , who then was responsible for policing the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits , `` was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time , '' including out-of-state trips , according to a New York Merc report prepared last year .
12827	`` We recognized the problem and took care of it . ''
12842	But in May , the Chicago Merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the Chicago Board of Trade , and it suspended negotiations with the New York Merc .
12847	Michael Frawley , metals trader for PaineWebber Inc. in New York , said there is good technical support between $ 1.10 and $ 1.12 a pound for December copper , which ended Friday at $ 1.1580 a pound , up 1.6 cents .
12848	He views the $ 1.10 to $ 1.12 range as a buying opportunity and considers the market oversold .
12850	But he said it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $ 1.10 and $ 1.25 .
12851	He noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on Wall Street .
12855	He said there are two reports this week that might affect prices : the purchasing managers report on Wednesday and the unemployment report on Friday .
12859	He thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets .
12860	According to Mr. Frawley , floor traders say there is good support for December gold in the $ 374 to $ 375 per ounce area , around $ 5.20 an ounce for December silver and in the $ 485 to $ 490 an ounce range for January platinum .
12865	`` I expect to see some selling , but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past '' by selling and locking in prices for their production ?
12867	Grains And Soybeans
12868	Prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of U.S. crops by the Soviet Union .
12869	In recent weeks , warm and dry weather has sped the Midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the 1988 drought .
12875	Investors usually do n't want to take physical delivery of a contract , preferring instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration .
12876	Employees of the Globe and Mail , a Thomson Corp. newspaper in Toronto , voted to accept a tentative contract agreement Saturday , averting a strike at Canada 's leading daily .
12877	Under the terms of the three-year contract , similar to one reached at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star newspaper earlier this month , the 500 Globe and Mail workers will see a raise of 8 % in the contract 's first year and 7 % in each of the following two years .
12879	In addition to wage increases , the union negotiated improved vacation plans , benefit packages and pension plans , Mr. Slotnick said .
12882	For three years , a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels .
12886	`` Put your money in a good utility or bank stock , not a paper company , '' advises George Adler of Smith Barney .
12888	Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. expects a 30 % decline in earnings between now and 1991 for `` commodity-oriented '' paper companies , which account for the majority of the industry .
12892	Generally they maintain that , barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies , the industry is n't headed for a prolonged slump .
12894	Last week Mr. Adler lowered his rating from hold to `` avoid '' on Boise Cascade , Champion International , Great Northern Nekoosa , International Paper , Louisiana Pacific and Weyerhaeuser .
12895	Oppenheimer 's Mr. Palmero , meanwhile , is steering clear of Gaylord Container , Stone Container and Federal Paper Board .
12896	Mr. Schneider is cool to Georgia Pacific and Abitibi-Price .
12905	Champion International said , `` We 've gotten our costs down and we 're better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we 've ever been . ''
12906	Louisiana Pacific and Georgia Pacific said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business .
12908	The company explained that its main product , bleached paperboard , which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes , historically does n't have sharp price swings .
12910	A company such as Federal Paper Board may be overly discounted and looks `` tempting '' to him , he says , though he is n't yet recommending the shares .
12912	Mr. Palmero recommends Temple-Inland , explaining that it is `` virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion , '' and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year .
12913	A Temple-Inland spokesman said the company expects record earnings in 1989 , and `` we 're still pretty bullish '' on 1990 .
12915	Some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper companies , which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices .
12916	Estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year currently run between $ 150 and $ 250 a metric ton .
12917	Analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers , Scott Paper and Kimberly-Clark .
12919	Shoney 's Inc. said it will report a write-off of $ 2.5 million , or seven cents a share , for its fourth quarter ended yesterday .
12926	These payments consisted of $ 54 million in scheduled payments and $ 121 million in prepayments , funded by $ 82.8 million from operating cash flow , zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales .
12932	The Dutch utility firm serves the Amsterdam and Utrecht areas .
12936	The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations .
12938	Last year , Mr. Kume said , Nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles , and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in North America , Europe and Australia .
12941	That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity , he acknowledged , but did n't provide specific details .
12945	National Intergroup in the year-ago third quarter earned $ 22.5 million , or 97 cents a share , including a gain of $ 18 million from the sale of a steel tube company .
12950	The extrusion unit produces bare and painted custom extrusions for building products and construction industries .
12951	In fiscal 1989 , it had sales of about $ 40 million and an operating loss of $ 1.5 million .
12952	The municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers .
12953	Commercial banks and property\/casualty insurers , which together own about 36 % of all municipal bonds , have been dumping their securities for weeks .
12959	`` People are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers . ''
12966	Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices , making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period .
12969	Big banks such as Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan , which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan-loss reserves , are n't looking for tax-exempt income .
12972	The spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its muni holdings , but could n't immediately confirm the amount .
12974	There is speculation that property\/casualty firms will sell even more munis as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake .
12976	Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue , at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs .
12977	The recent natural disasters , and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure , suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off .
12985	The offering will include $ 729 million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $ 57.8 million of taxable bonds .
12988	On Friday , some issues fell nearly one point , or close to $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
12989	The sell-off in New York City bonds was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election .
12990	The city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling .
12994	Overall , he says , municipal prices are `` very cheap '' and represent an `` excellent buying opportunity . ''
12996	Treasury bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week 's Treasury debt auction and rumors that a major Japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long-term bonds .
12999	Late Thursday , the Treasury said it needed to raise $ 17 billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week .
13000	Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ 17 billion of cash management bills .
13001	Instead , the Treasury announced it would sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today , as usual , but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday .
13005	The firm is thought to have purchased up to $ 3 billion of 30-year bonds in a buying spree on Wednesday and the previous Thursday .
13006	Dealers say the firm apparently has wanted to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30-year bonds by using Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corp. as a broker .
13008	Nippon Kangyo 's moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors , many of whom decided to stay out of the market .
13009	As a result of its large-scale buying , some analysts now say that liquidity , or the ability to easily buy and sell , has been constrained in the benchmark Treasury bond issue .
13013	`` It shows that there are buyers of high-quality assets at high prices in today 's market , '' said Robert Long , managing director and head of the high-yield research department at First Boston Corp .
13014	Many of the RJR securities , which had been trading near their 52-week lows earlier in the session , bounced back after the company 's announcement that it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods , a unit of the Swiss-based food concern .
13022	-- Mortgage securities fell 7\/32 to 8\/32 but held up better than intermediate Treasurys .
13025	The premium the elderly pay for coverage of doctor 's bills under Part B of the Medicare health insurance plan will rise to $ 29 a month in 1990 from $ 27.90 , the Department of Health and Human Services said .
13028	Under a less-sweeping Senate plan , the catastrophic-care monthly premium would continue , rising to $ 4.90 next year , but the surtax would be abolished .
13031	Both the House and Senate bills to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic-care plan would eliminate the cap on doctor 's bills .
13034	Most of Part A 's costs are paid by a payroll tax on workers and employers .
13035	Lockheed Corp. said it will trim its Aeronautical Systems work force in California and Georgia by several hundred workers , reflecting the defense industry 's decline .
13036	The Lockheed unit has 24,000 workers ; it expects to make the cuts through a combination of furloughs , attrition and retirements .
13043	Jim Pattison Industries , a holding company with annual sales of about C$ 1.9 billion , largely from car dealerships and grocery stores , did n't elaborate on the statement , and a company official declined further comment .
13045	Separately , Innopac reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C$ 2.6 million , or 18 Canadian cents a share , reflecting inventory write-downs .
13046	The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year .
13048	Martin Fabi , Innopac 's president and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move .
13052	A joint venture involving units of Innopac and Mobil Corp. earlier this year opened the first U.S. polystyrene recycling plant , in Leominster , Mass .
13053	PROGRAM TRADING is being curbed by more securities firms , but big institutional investors are expected to continue the practice , further roiling the stock market .
13054	Bowing to criticism , Bear Stearns , Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer joined PaineWebber in suspending stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts .
13056	Several Big Board firms are organizing to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it .
13065	LIN Broadcasting and BellSouth sweetened their plan to merge cellular phone operations , offering LIN holders a special $ 42-a-share payout .
13066	But the new pact will force huge debt on the new firm and could still fail to thwart rival suitor McCaw Cellular .
13067	Unisys posted a $ 648.2 million loss for the third quarter as it moved quickly to take write-offs for various problems and prepare for a turnaround .
13070	The accord helps RJR pay off debt and boosts Nestle 's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to 12 % .

13086	Thomas Jefferson sold Congress on the idea of the decimal system for currency , thus saving Americans the headaches of pounds , shillings and pence .
13087	But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the French had invented .
13088	Instead , Congress opted for the inches , feet and yards the colonists had brought with them .
13091	In 1807 , the Swiss mathematician who headed the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made an `` iron meter '' that he had brought from Europe the standard of measure .
13096	-LRB- The press had a field day with questions about what would happen to `` six-footer , '' `` yardstick '' and `` inchworm . '' -RRB-
13097	Today , though the public is barely aware , much of U.S. industry , particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas , have made metrics routine .
13098	General Motors , for example , uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power trains .
13100	Farm-machine makers such as Caterpillar and Deere work in the metric system .
13104	Still , like the auto makers , when dealing with Mr. Everyman the Pentagon sticks to the tried and true .
13105	Soldiers and sailors are still measured in inches and pounds .
13106	Whittle Communications L.P. , which for months has fought a public relations battle with education leaders , said it has signed 500 schools in 24 states to subscribe to the controversial Channel One news program and its sister programs .
13108	Whittle said its field staff signed up the 500 schools in 238 school districts after only eight weeks and company executives now expect to reach their start-up goal of 1,000 schools before the end of this year .
13113	In California and New York , state officials have opposed Channel One .
13114	Mr. Whittle said private and parochial schools in both states will be canvassed to see if they are interested in getting the programs .
13116	Subscribers also get the Classroom Channel , which will feature ad-free educational programming similar to some public-TV shows , and the Educator 's Channel , which will offer instructional programming for teachers and school administrators and will be supported by advertising .
13118	The Educational Network , as Mr. Whittle has named the three programs , has been offered to 1,290 school districts and Whittle continues to negotiate with 919 districts .
13122	John Bruner , associate director of communications for Cincinnati Public Schools , said Channel One was rejected because students watching the program did n't fare particularly better on a 28-question current events quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired .
13123	`` The number of correct responses was 45 % on the test and school absences did n't change much , '' said Mr. Bruner .
13124	`` The pilot program was received well -LRB- by teachers and students -RRB- , but there was n't reason enough to sign up .
13125	We even invited the public to stop by and see the program , but there was n't much interest . ''
13130	Installation of satellite dishes , TVs and videocassette equipment will cost the company about $ 20,000 per school , Mr. Whittle said .
13131	The following U.S. Treasury , corporate and municipal offerings are tentatively scheduled for sale this week , according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :

13147	New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust -- $ 75,075,000 of various bonds , including $ 40.86 million Wastewater Treatment insured bonds , Series 1989A , and $ 34,215,000 Wastewater Treatment bonds , Series 1989B , via competitive bid .
13151	Maryland Community Development Administration , Department of Housing and Community Development -- $ 80 million of single-family program bonds , 1989 4th and 5th Series , via a Merrill Lynch group .
13152	Matagorda County Navigation District No. 1 , Texas -- $ 70,315,000 of pollution control revenue Alternative Minimum Tax -LRB- AMT -RRB- bonds -LRB- South Texas Project Units No. 1 and 2 -RRB- , via a Goldman Sachs group .
13153	New York City -- $ 786,860,000 of bonds , Fiscal 1990 Series C and D , including $ 729.04 million tax-exempt bonds and $ 57.82 million taxable bonds , via a Goldman Sachs group .
13157	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Hewlett-Packard said it now holds 1,384,119 Octel common shares , including 100,000 shares bought from Aug. 26 to Oct. 20 for $ 23.31 to $ 24.25 a share .
13158	Hewlett-Packard , a Palo Alto , Calif. , computer company , said it acquired the stock `` to develop and maintain a strategic partnership in which each company remains independent while working together to market and sell their products . ''

13178	Since peaking at 2791.41 on Oct. 9 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 194.69 points , or 7 % , closing Friday at 2596.72 , down 17.01 .
13182	Opinions vary about how important the UAL deal was to the market 's health , but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the UAL plan crumbled revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology .
13184	There are , of course , analysts who view the near-panic that briefly swept through investors on Oct. 13 and again on Oct. 24 as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market .
13185	Sure , price action is volatile and that 's scary , but all-in-all stocks are still a good place to be , they suggest .
13192	`` There may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they 've done in the past , but deals wo n't disappear . ''
13193	He forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls `` strategic deals , in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow , but because it 's a good fit . ''
13195	He notes , for instance , that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1986 , yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high .
13196	`` Those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up , '' he says .
13197	Even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad , in Mr. Connolly 's view .
13199	`` Who can make the better decision , the guy who has 10 seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world ? '' he says .
13202	`` We 've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy , '' he says .
13205	`` It provided an excuse for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data , especially the third-quarter economic numbers , and to realize that we ca n't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk bond market . ''
13212	Her view is that stock prices have three major props : merger and buy-out proposals , earnings and the economic outlook .
13213	At current levels of economic activity and earnings , stocks are fairly valued , she says .
13214	But any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business , and UAL has obviously put a damper on that .
13215	`` Stocks are n't cheap anymore , there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals , '' she says .
13216	`` I 'm not saying they 've stopped altogether , but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high . ''
13218	The other two props -- earnings and the economic outlook -- are troubling , too .
13219	`` M&A is getting all the headlines right now , but these other things have been building up more gradually , '' she says .
13220	Third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing , the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of 1990 is getting worse .
13221	`` There are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices , '' she says .
13227	Stock prices tumbled for a third consecutive day as earnings disappointments , a sluggish economy and a fragile junk bond market continued to weigh on investors .
13231	For the week the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 92.42 points , or 3.4 % .
13232	Oil stocks escaped the brunt of Friday 's selling and several were able to post gains , including Chevron , which rose 5\/8 to 66 3\/8 in Big Board composite trading of 2.4 million shares .
13234	Both companies declined to comment on the rumors , but several industry analysts told the Professional Investor Report they believed it was plausible that Pennzoil may be buying Chevron shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the company .
13235	USX gained 1\/2 to 33 3\/8 on a report in Business Week magazine that investor Carl Icahn is said to have raised his stake in the oil and steel company to just about 15 % .
13237	Elsewhere in the oil sector , Exxon rallied 7\/8 to 45 3\/4 ; Amoco rose 1\/8 to 47 ; Texaco was unchanged at 51 3\/4 , and Atlantic Richfield fell 1 5\/8 to 99 1\/2 .
13238	Mobil , which said it plans to cut its exploration and production work force by about 8 % in a restructuring , dropped 5\/8 to 56 1\/8 .
13240	Hecla Mining rose 5\/8 to 14 ; Battle Mountain Gold climbed 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 ; Homestake Mining rose 1 1\/8 to 16 7\/8 ; Lac Minerals added 5\/8 to 11 ; Placer Dome went up 7\/8 to 16 3\/4 , and ASA Ltd. jumped 3 5\/8 to 49 5\/8 .
13242	Echo Bay Mines rose 5\/8 to 15 7\/8 ; Pegasus Gold advanced 1 1\/2 to 12 , and Corona Class A gained 1\/2 to 7 1\/2 .
13243	Unisys dropped 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 after posting a third-quarter loss of $ 4.25 a share , including restructuring charges , but other important technology issues were mixed .
13246	Digital Equipment tacked on 1 1\/8 to 89 1\/8 , and Hewlett-Packard fell 3\/8 to 49 3\/8 .
13248	The stock has a 3.5 % dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today .
13253	Crane said it holds an 8.9 % stake in the company and may seek control .
13258	For several months , officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight .
13259	The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing the DC-10 's hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash that killed 112 people .
13264	Anthony Broderick , the FAA 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance , said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago .
13265	He said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time , and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur .
13266	The FAA already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber .
13268	A spokesman for GE said that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections . ''
13272	Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years .
13273	The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in the century ahead .
13274	A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth 's polar ice caps , raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas .
13275	`` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples .
13286	But he said ice samples from Peru , Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming .
13287	Telxon Corp. said its vice president for manufacturing resigned and its Houston work force has been trimmed by 40 people , or about 15 % .
13288	The maker of hand-held computers and computer systems said the personnel changes were needed to improve the efficiency of its manufacturing operation .
13292	As reported , CNW agreed to be acquired by a group of investors led by Blackstone Capital Partners Limited Partnership for $ 50 a share , or about $ 950 million .
13294	The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees , and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S. 's standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable .
13295	Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany , Japan , South Korea , the United Kingdom and the Philippines , for example , are cut by almost two-thirds , while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home .
13296	The result is that instead of the Pentagon 's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30 .
13300	Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request .
13301	Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less , their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640 % and 430 % , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures .
13302	The swift passage of the bill , which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $ 66.8 billion measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs .
13303	By an 84-6 margin , the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday , but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration .
13304	The House Democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions , but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere .
13305	Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as $ 1 billion in spending , and as critics have awakened to these devices , the bill can seem like a wounded caribou trying to make it past ice and wolves to reach safer winter grazing .
13306	Much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal 1991 , and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow-spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster-spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed .
13307	For example , a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $ 592 million , or more than $ 200 million above what either chamber had previously approved .
13309	But as much as $ 177 million , or nearly 30 % of the account , is marked for potential transfers to research , management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip .
13311	Conservatives , embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress .
13312	HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week , but received little support from the White House budget office , which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments .
13314	House Speaker Thomas Foley won $ 510,000 for a project in his district in Washington state , and $ 1.3 million , earmarked by Sen. Daniel Inouye , amounts to a business subsidy under the title `` Hawaiian sugar mills job retention . ''
13319	Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old .
13320	Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s .
13321	Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families .
13322	These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life .
13324	And today , many of their children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren remain on welfare .
13326	Or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums .
13327	Farmers in the Midwest and other areas have suffered , but those along the Mississippi continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery .
13334	Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral .
13336	The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students .
13337	Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians .
13338	Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance .
13339	Does the Delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents , black and white , do not realize racism alienates potential employers ?
13340	Should we focus on the region 's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards , mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways -LRB- abstinence or contraceptives -RRB- of decreasing teen pregnancy ?
13345	The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says , `` Aw heck , guys , nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea , '' I wish you would butt in and say , `` Hold it , fellas , why do n't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country .
13353	For years , we tried to ignore the problem of poverty , and now that it has gotten out of hand it 's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress .
13354	Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in `` Sugar Ditch , '' but when you travel to Washington , Boston , Chicago or New York , the same problems exist .
13355	The only difference is , in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room , with rusty pipes called plumbing , rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers .
13356	Many middle-class people would love free food , Medicaid insurance , utilities and rent .
13357	Then maybe I could stay home and have seven children and watch Oprah Winfrey , like Beulah in the article , instead of having one child and working constantly just to stay above water , like so many families in this country .
13360	Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S. , by as much as 15 % as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business .
13361	Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 people .
13365	But since then U.S. oil production has declined and Mobil wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas .
13366	Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $ 40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring .
13368	On Wednesday , Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation .
13370	During the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous .
13372	`` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said Charles E. Spruell , president of the Mobil unit .
13373	Field offices at New Orleans ; Houston ; Denver ; Midland , Tex. ; Bakersfield , Calif. ; Oklahoma City ; and Liberal , Kan. , will be maintained .
13377	The reorganization will `` focus on the value and potential of assets , '' Mr. Spruell said .
13378	Wanted : An investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about .
13380	In April , when many of them bought their CDs , six-month certificates were yielding more than 9 % ; investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts .
13381	Now , the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8 % , and 8.5 % is about the best around .
13387	Short-term municipal bonds , bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return .
13389	A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense .
13390	`` People should remember their money is n't all or nothing -- they do n't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it , '' says Bethesda , Md. , adviser Karen Schaeffer .
13395	That 's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax -- and from state and local taxes too , for in-state investors .
13401	Consider a `` laddered '' bond portfolio , with issues maturing in , say , 1992 , 1993 and 1994 , advises Malcolm A. Makin , a Westerly , R.I. , financial planner .
13404	Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell .
13407	But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead .
13408	Bond resale prices , and thus fund share prices , move in the opposite direction from rates .
13411	The Short Term Bond Fund , with an average maturity of 2 1\/2 years , would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6 % if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6 % if rates rise by the same amount .
13412	But , in the same circumstances , the returns would be a more extreme 14.6 % and 2.6 % for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund , with its 12 1\/2-year average maturity .
13416	These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts : Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn , but a 10 % penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1\/2 .
13417	Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity .
13418	An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years , after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities .
13420	For instance , a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance , Chicago , offers 8.8 % interest for one year or a 9 % rate for two years .
13425	The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present , when rates seem headed down .
13426	With average maturities of a month or so , money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates , with a slight lag .
13431	Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates , suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc. , a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co .
13437	Dr. Solomon Sobel , director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , said FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland 's findings `` fairly intensively . ''
13438	While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S. , Dr. Sobel said the FDA plans to examine Dr. Toseland 's evidence and is considering its own study here .
13439	Dr. Toseland , a toxicologist , said he was preparing an article for a British forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar , which can kill diabetics .
13440	The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating , anxiety and cramps .
13441	With proper warning , diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food .
13446	`` We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar , '' Dr. Sobel said .
13447	The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster , he said .
13450	Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain 's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland 's findings .
13455	Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein , France .
13457	Lilly officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin , but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths .
13458	Dr. Leigh Thompson , a Lilly group vice president , said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product .
13462	The company , which makes data base systems and software , said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 .
13465	We 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget .
13468	This wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures .
13469	As it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy to counter these threats , we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces .
13470	These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper , and each year , their end product -- the Five Year Defense Plan -- promptly melts away .
13473	The Pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats .
13474	Strategy , however , is about possibilities , not hopes and dreams .
13476	That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budgeteers , and pork-barrelers .
13485	This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning .
13489	Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ 100 billion .
13494	The Pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ 22 billion in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ 23 billion in an `` above guidance '' management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future .
13498	By adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate , we arrive at a baseline program costing $ 1.7 trillion between 1990 and 1994 .
13499	Step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security .
13504	This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985 , and it reduces the baseline by $ 106 billion between 1990 and 1994 .
13506	It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994 .
13508	Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate ; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3 , by increasing the budget at 2 % per year .
13511	This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union .
13512	The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses .
13513	They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations .
13515	If , for example , they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber , they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels .
13518	But ZBB did not involve the strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics .
13521	It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions : Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals .
13523	This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress , and unfortunately , there is some truth to it .
13526	Strategy is not a game between the Pentagon and Congress ; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives .
13528	Strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events ; it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial , cultural and physical limitations .
13533	While Wall Street 's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar , weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors .
13536	In late Friday afternoon New York trading , the dollar was at 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen , off from late Thursday 's 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen .
13539	The dollar began Friday on a firm note , gaining against all major currencies in Tokyo dealings and early European trading despite reports that the Bank of Japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen .
13541	But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , the dollar was dragged down , traders say , by the stock-market slump that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of 17.01 points .
13542	With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments , traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position .
13544	While some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen , Mr. Scalfaro and others do n't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140 yen soon .
13545	Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after Mr. Lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats .
13546	With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies , `` you do n't have a confirmation '' that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works , says Mike Malpede , senior currency analyst at Refco Inc. in Chicago .
13549	Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members .
13550	He was succeeded by John Major , who Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation .
13551	But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound , currency analysts contend .
13555	`` There 's very little upside to sterling , '' Mr. Roberts says , but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed Mr. Major 's appointment apparently has run its course .
13556	But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound , particularly because Britain 's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about 7.6 % and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits .
13557	The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year , says Nigel Rendell , an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London .
13564	The yen 's softness , she says , apparently stems from Japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase U.S. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the Japanese government .
13568	We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled ... . ''
13569	Perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy . ''
13573	The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , Senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials .
13575	Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities .
13578	For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families , this legislation is the `` Emancipation Proclamation . ''
13582	A group of investors led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman , Burt Sugarman , said it filed with federal antitrust regulators for clearance to buy more than 50 % of the stock of Rally 's Inc. , a fast-food company based in Louisville , Ky .
13583	Rally 's operates and franchises about 160 fast-food restaurants throughout the U.S. .
13585	Giant has interests in cement making and newsprint .
13586	The investor group includes Restaurant Investment Partnership , a California general partnership , and three Rally 's directors : Mr. Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II .
13587	The group currently holds 3,027,330 Rally 's shares , or 45.2 % of its commmon shares outstanding .
13592	For the year ended July 2 , Rally had net income of $ 2.4 million , or 34 cents a share , on revenue of $ 52.9 million .
13594	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
13595	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
13598	DPC Acquisition Partners , a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp. , filed a petition in federal district court in Los Angeles seeking to have its standstill agreement with the computer printer maker declared void , and it proceeded with a $ 10-a-share tender offer for the company .
13602	Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' chairman , said he had n't yet seen the filing and could n't comment .
13603	DPC made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable .
13604	Dataproducts had sought a buyer for several months , but it is now in the midst of a restructuring plan and management says the company is no longer for sale .
13607	The European Community 's consumer price index rose a provisional 0.6 % in September from August and was up 5.3 % from September 1988 , according to Eurostat , the EC 's statistical agency .
13611	The contract was first proposed more than two years ago , but shortly afterward , the colony 's markets were hit hard by the October 1987 global stock crash .
13613	The Securities and Futures Commission , a government watchdog set up after the 1987 crash to try to restore confidence and order to Hong Kong 's markets , had been expected to give the contract conditional approval last week .
13617	Analysts and financial officials in the British colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the October 1987 crash .
13620	The contract will be based on the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate , or Hibor .
13623	`` The contract is definitely important to the exchange , '' says Robert Gilmore , executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission .
13626	-LCB- A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date .
13627	In the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures , the instruments are given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash . -RCB-
13628	But in the week following the 1987 stock crash , the exchange verged on collapse , and the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong were closed for four days .
13632	Despite the thin trading , and after two painful years of restructuring , the futures market has shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests .
13633	While Asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the Oct. 13 plunge in New York stock prices , futures trading in Hong Kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly .
13636	Most important to the contract 's success is the commitment of Hong Kong 's big financial institutions , especially the two leaders , Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. and the local subsidiary of Britain 's Standard Chartered Bank PLC .
13638	`` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official .
13640	Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed exchange rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go .
13641	In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % .
13645	The wounds from the 1987 crash have n't yet healed , and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the Hang Seng index would fall -- have been settled .
13646	Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its futures market .
13649	Exchange officials also point out that Hibor futures were designed for institutions and corporations , not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in Hang Seng index futures and defaulted in the 1987 crash .
13651	`` You 're not going to get your taxi drivers and amahs and all that , '' says Rory Nicholas , a director for securities company Elders Bullion & Futures Ltd .
13654	Two of Japan 's largest paper manufacturers , Oji Paper Co. and Jujo Paper Co. , posted unconsolidated pretax profit gains from a year earlier for the first half ended Sept. 30 , on continuing robust domestic demand for paper products .
13659	Oji Paper 's sales strength was evident in overall paper products sales , including newsprints , printing and wrapping papers , which rose to 221.61 billion yen in the first half from 200.70 billion yen a year earlier .
13660	Pulp , processed and miscellaneous paper sales also surged .
13663	The company did n't provide an explanation for the softer pretax profit performance and officials could n't be reached for comment .
13668	General paper product sales , including newsprints and other papers , accounting for the bulk of sales , rose to 157.78 billion yen from 143.88 billion yen .
13671	Unocal Corp. 's decision to put its Norwegian oil and gas interests up for sale earlier this week is another step in the company 's strategic review of its properties , and shows that few of them are sacred cows .
13673	But Eugene L. Nowak , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , forecast that the sale will bring in `` $ 200 million or substantially more . ''
13674	The proposed transaction is the latest in a redeployment of assets by the Los Angeles-based oil company that has included the $ 200 million sale of its headquarters property and the pending sale of half of its Chicago refinery and related marketing operations to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A .
13675	Mr. Nowak said he attaches particular importance to the proposed sale because it suggests that the company is willing to sell oil and gas assets that are n't part of its major strategic strengths .
13676	Unocal said it expects to complete the sale of its Unocal Norge A\/S unit by next March or April .
13677	In addition to an 18 % stake in the Veslefrikk offshore field , the Norwegian unit has interests ranging from 10 % to 25 % in three other Norwegian oil and gas production licenses .
13681	The field is currently being developed and is slated to start production by the end of the year .
13686	The company has retained J. Henry Schroder Wagg & Co. as financial adviser and agent for the sale .

13745	As of Sept. 30 , the bank had assets of $ 511 million and deposits of $ 469 million , Security Pacific said .
13747	South Africa 's current account surplus swelled to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of between five billion and six billion rand -LRB- $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.28 billion -RRB- in the third quarter , Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said .
13748	The surplus was two billion rand in the second quarter and 2.7 billion rand in the first quarter .
13755	The funeral home and cemetery operator changed from a fiscal year to a calendar year in December .
13756	In the comparable year-ago quarter , the second quarter ended Oct. 31 , Service Corp. had a loss of about $ 12.5 million , or 26 cents a share , on revenue of $ 175.4 million .
13757	Results for that quarter included a $ 30 million , or 40 cents a share , write-down associated with the consolidation of a facility .
13759	I have just returned from France , and the net exchange rate charged on my Visa account was more favorable than I obtained for traveler 's checks in any of the several banks where I converted them .
13761	The state-controlled French metals group Pechiney S.A. said it has signed a preliminary accord to sell its Paris headquarters to Groupement Foncier Francais and Nouveaux Constructeurs for 2.76 billion francs -LRB- $ 443 million -RRB- .
13762	The sale , which Pechiney had been eager to make for several months , is still subject to certain unspecified conditions and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 1990 , the group .
13764	The Consumer Price Index `` A '' , which measures price changes for the 50 % of urban households that spend between 2,000 Hong Kong dollars -LRB- US$ 256.18 -RRB- and HK$ 6,499 a month , edged up 1.5 % in September from August .
13765	Index `` B '' , which monitors price changes for the 30 % of urban households that spend between HK$ 6,500 and HK$ 9,999 a month , rose 9.9 % last month from a year earlier and was up 1.3 % from the preceding month .
13766	September 's Hang Seng Consumer Price Index , which measures price changes for the 10 % of urban households spending HK$ 10,000 and HK$ 24,999 a month , was up 11 % from a year ago and up 1.3 % from August .
13767	The main factors for the September increase from the previous month were higher prices for services , food and housing .
13768	Prices fell marginally for fuel and electricity .
13769	West German and French authorities have cleared Dresdner Bank AG 's takeover of a majority stake in Banque Internationale de Placement -LRB- BIP -RRB- , Dresdner Bank said .
13771	In a first step , Dresdner Bank will buy 32.99 % of BIP for 1,015 French francs -LRB- $ 162 -RRB- a share , or 528 million francs -LRB- $ 84.7 million -RRB- .
13774	Furukawa Electric Co. , one of Japan 's leading electric wire and cable manufacturers , said unconsolidated pretax profit in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 fell 5.3 % to 6.11 billion yen -LRB- $ 43.1 million -RRB- from 6.45 billion yen a year earlier .
13778	The growing sales sustained by domestic demand failed to counter rising material metal costs and declining profitability in overseas construction , Furukawa said .
13780	Sales by category rose 24 % to 35.23 billion yen , reflecting increased production in automobile , airconditioner and electric machine industries , which are major users of wire and cable products .
13781	Sales for electric wires and cables rose 13.2 % to 153.93 billion yen .
13782	West Germany 's cost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.3 % in October from September and was up 3.3 % from a year earlier , the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said .
13784	Preliminary cost-of-living data for the current month are calculated based on inflation data from the four largest West German states -- Baden-Wuerttemberg , North Rhine-Westphalia , Bavaria and Hesse .
13786	The project costs $ 46.8 million , and is intended to boost the company 's production capacity by 25 % to 34,500 metric tons of copper cathode a year .
13787	Outokumpu is a mining , trading and construction concern .
13788	September sales at major Japanese retail stores rose 9.4 % from a year earlier to 1.388 trillion yen -LRB- $ 9.81 billion -RRB- , marking the fifth-consecutive monthly increase , the Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced .
13790	September 's growth followed a 8.7 % rise in July and an 8 % increase in August , showing continued expansion at high year-on-year levels .
13792	Shell Canada Ltd. said it plans to build a lubricants blending and packaging plant at Brockville , Ontario , with start-up scheduled for 1992 .
13793	A spokesman said the plant , which will replace older lubricant and grease manufacturing plants in Montreal and Toronto , will cost about 50 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 42.5 million -RRB- to build .
13795	Shell Canada , an oil and gas producer and marketer , is a unit of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group , an Anglo-Dutch concern .
13797	That 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence .
13800	`` I 'm not saying London covered itself in glory , but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe 's weaknesses , '' says Stewart Gilchrist , a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow , Scotland , which manages about # 6 billion -LRB- $ 9.63 billion -RRB- in institutional money .
13801	He says the problems on European exchanges included market-system breakdowns , delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions .
13803	Unable to unload a large block of a French blue-chip company 's shares in Paris for two days last week , a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called James Capel & Co. , a London brokerage firm .
13805	On so-called Manic Monday , Oct. 16 , stock prices plunged across Europe and trading problems erupted .
13807	The London exchange 's electronic price-reporting system provided only indicative , or non-firm , prices for about 40 minutes on Manic Monday .
13813	The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week , with the aid of Toronto Stock Exchange officials who developed the system .
13816	Exchange officials extended trading hours , 75 minutes on Monday and 65 minutes on Tuesday , to clear up order backlogs .
13817	In France , more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks -- including such giants as BSN and Elf Aquitaine -- did n't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day , traders say .
13823	On Manic Monday , the volume of German shares traded in London more than tripled to 2.2 million , and the volume of French shares rose 48 % .
13828	Though the widely traded shares that are quoted in London account for only a small portion of those totals , they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally .
13829	The switch to London underscores the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with European Community efforts to develop a single market by 1992 , European stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity .
13831	Rather , there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most European financial centers -- including European giants such as Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank , as well as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S. and Japan 's Nomura Securities Co .
13836	He acknowledges that spreads `` were too wide and volumes too light '' in the extreme conditions on Manic Monday .
13837	Already the Germans appear to be acting ; at a special meeting on the day of the decline , directors of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange voted to extend their trading hours , although they have n't decided when or by how much .
13845	But they either did n't buy the right machines or they wasted it , '' says Fleming 's Ms. Noble .
13846	Canadian steel production totaled 290,541 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 21 , a 5.1 % increase from 276,334 tons the previous week but a 7.2 % decline from 313,125 tons a year earlier , Statistics Canada said .
13852	Calgene Inc. and Gustafson Inc. said they plan a joint project to develop biological products to control such plant diseases as aflatoxin , a potent cancer-causing agent .
13855	The strain was discovered by Morinaga & Co. and licensed to Gustafson , a unit of Uniroyal Chemical Co .
13856	Aflatoxin is released by molds during grain and seed storage .
13857	The recent appearance of aflatoxin in such foods as corn and peanut butter has sparked public concern and consumer scrutiny of food handling and storage procedures .
13859	`` We do n't want Brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful , '' said Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz , secretary general of the employers ' confederation Unice .
13860	Unice -- an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe -- fears that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations .
13861	Workers and management , Mr. Tyszkiewicz said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions .
13867	Mr. Tyszkiewicz said the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain , Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage .
13868	It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours , and provide for collective bargaining and worker `` participation '' in major corporate decisions .
13870	Indeed , lower wages -- in Greece , they are a third of the EC average -- are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries .
13872	But the Unice official said that producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry is n't an unattainable goal .
13875	This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of `` social engineering '' by the commission .
13876	One possible political solution , an EC official said , would be for the commission to present the action program in late November , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9 .
13879	France 's Socialist government , which currently holds the council 's rotating presidency , is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its `` Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
13881	Sam Ramirez and his men are late .
13882	They pile out of their truck and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the Sharpshooter , a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep .
13885	`` We 've been putting in long hours , '' Mr. Ramirez says -- six-day weeks and 13-hour days for the last two months .
13886	A year ago , when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes , `` you 'd spend two days working and two days in the yard , '' he recalls .
13887	After a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices , draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs , fear is finally leaving the oil patch .
13890	Investment capital is creeping back , and oil properties are fetching more .
13894	Mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now .
13895	`` The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices , '' says Victor Burk , an Arthur Andersen & Co. oil expert .
13897	That is n't the $ 40 that delighted producers a decade ago or the $ 10 that pleased users a year ago .
13898	But it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies , low enough to promote consumption and , most important , steady enough for both producers and users to believe in .
13900	The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC , producer of more than 40 % of the non-Communist world 's crude .
13901	A recession or new OPEC blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup .
13902	Also , the new stirrings are faint , and some question their extent .
13903	Drilling activity is still far below eight years ago , there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink .
13908	The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets .
13916	About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession .
13920	It is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day , or up to 2 % annually , for years to come .
13922	The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer .
13927	Being held well below capacity greatly irritates them , and has led to widespread cheating .
13929	Oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an Iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway .
13930	But `` if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem , production could increase to 23 million or 24 million barrels a day , making for a very troublesome first quarter , '' warns Nordine Ait-Laoussine , a consultant and former Algerian OPEC delegate .
13932	Patrick J . Early , president of Amoco Corp. 's oil-production unit , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending .
13934	Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations .
13935	Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun .
13939	Santa Fe aims to drill about 30 wells in this area in 1989 and double that next year .
13940	It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only company with a new attitude , as it found when it went looking for a partner for the Sharpshooter .
13943	Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. became the partner , ponying up more than half of the $ 600,000 in drilling and start-up costs .
13947	One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work .
13948	Kadane Oil Co. , a small Texas independent , is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others .
13950	`` At this price , $ 18 plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago , the economics are pretty good , '' says George Kadane , head of the company .
13958	Most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for this year , forecast revenue of $ 15 for each barrel of crude produced .
13959	Prices have averaged more than $ 2 a barrel higher than that -- not a windfall , but at least a pleasant bonus for them .
13965	Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says William Thomas , a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''
13968	Contractors such as Parker Drilling Co. are raising cash again through stock offerings , and for the first time in years , two oil-service companies recently went public .
13969	-LRB- They are Grace Energy Corp. of Dallas and Marine Drilling Co. of Houston . -RRB-
13970	Most oil companies are still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs they slashed so deeply .
13973	Out in the oil fields , if activity picks up much more , shortages could appear because so many roughnecks , roustabouts and others left after the crash .
13978	Norman Young , a `` mud-logger '' at the Sniper well , has worked all but about nine days of this year .
13979	Last year , `` I was off a straight month , then one time for two to three weeks and another two to three weeks , '' he says .
13988	Only 14,505 wells , including 4,900 dry holes , were drilled for oil and natural gas in the U.S. in the first nine months of the year , down 22.4 % from the like 1988 period .
13996	The rig was built around 1980 , but has drilled only two wells , the last in 1982 .
13998	For Zel Herring , owner and a cook at the Sandhills Luncheon Cafe , a tin building in midtown , all this has made for a very good year .
13999	After 11:30 a.m. or so `` we have them standing and waiting , '' she says , as she whips out orders for hamburgers and the daily special -LRB- grilled roast beef , cheese and jalapeno pepper sandwich on whole wheat , potato salad , baked beans and pudding , plus coffee or iced tea .
14002	He started Arrow Roustabouts Inc. a year ago with a loan from a friend , since repaid , and now employs 15 .
14003	He got three trucks and a backhoe cheap .
14011	The arrests capped a four-month investigation by the Internal Revenue Service , the U.S. Attorney 's office and a Security Pacific internal investigation team .
14012	Walter S. Fisher , executive vice president and general auditor of the bank 's parent , Security Pacific Corp. , said no bank funds were at risk during the investigation .
14013	Arrested were Jose O. Lopez , 27 years old , of Whittier , Calif. , the vault supervisor ; Carlos O. Huerta , 29 , of La Puente ; Luis A. Arroyo , 36 , of Los Angeles ; Ignacio Rojas Jr. , 32 , of Baldwin Park ; Doris Moreno , 37 , of Bell Gardens ; and Ana L. Azucena , 27 , of Huntington Park .
14014	Geno M. Apicella , 27 , of Los Angeles , and Terrell N. Madison , 27 , of Hawthorne , were also charged with participating in the conspiracy .
14015	Each defendant faces a possible sentence of 20 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines .
14020	Australia 's National Companies and Securities Commission said it will allow S.A. Brewing to acquire an option on as much as 20 % of Bell Resources Ltd. , a unit of Bond Corp. that is in the process of acquiring Bond Corp. 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 1.93 billion -RRB- .
14022	Bond Corp. , a brewing , property , media and resources concern controlled by financier Alan Bond , is selling many of its assets to reduce an A$ 6.9 billion debt .
14023	Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman 's recent Money Matters article -LRB- `` Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts '' Oct. 3 -RRB- , I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom .
14025	Mr. Dorfman states that an investor who invested $ 100,000 a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later , purchasing the four new pro picks , and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ 166,537 , excluding account dividends , taxes and commissions .

14048	In recent months , more than 25 agencies have been robbed , compared with only a handful all last year , according to police and travel-agency groups .
14049	Most of the cases have been in California , where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed .
14053	Police say the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men , who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time , when few employees are there .
14055	But then , he says , they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded he open the safe .
14056	When he initially refused , he says , they stabbed him in the back and made off with $ 2,000 and 280 blank tickets .
14059	At El Monte Travel Center in El Monte , Calif. , customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system .
14060	`` It 's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business , '' says Ralph `` Bud '' Conner , owner of the agency , which was robbed of 180 blank tickets and $ 850 last month .
14066	But airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate .
14075	A spokesman for Hertz Corp. acknowledges , `` The waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers , but a source of revenue . ''
14079	IF YOUR FLIGHT attendant seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working 20 straight hours .
14082	This happens because the FAA does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants ; by contrast , it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers , usually to a maximum of 10 consecutive hours .
14087	`` They have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation . ''
14089	The agency may not have much choice : A congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to 14 hours on U.S. flights and 16 hours on international trips .

14105	Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6 % rate without indexation .
14107	As you can see , the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary , but permanent .
14108	I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .
14111	The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses .
14113	To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense .
14114	A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation .
14115	Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ?
14117	Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1 % or 2 % a year .
14118	The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .
14120	Isaac Hersly , 41 years old , was elected president and chief operating officer of this designer and marketer of graphics , video , cable and other television-related equipment .
14121	He succeeds Alfred O.P. Leubert , 66 , who continues as chairman and chief executive officer .
14122	Mr. Hersly formerly was group vice president of marketing and product planning for Chyron and president of the telesystems and video products division .
14123	W.R. Grace & Co. said it formed a new horticultural-products company by combining its soil-nutrients and fertilizers business with Sierra Chemical Co. , Milpitas , Calif .

14130	The balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures .
14133	The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held .
14134	It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments .
14135	The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument .
14140	The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well .
14144	In the year-earlier third quarter , Poughkeepsie Savings had net income of $ 2.8 million , or 77 cents a share .
14146	The bank also said its effort would continue past the Nov. 1 deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might resume as a result .

14154	A potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of Italian , U.S. and Japanese scientists .
14157	The current vaccine for whooping cough , or pertussis , is part of the `` DPT '' -LRB- for diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus -RRB- shot given most infants and young children .
14167	The researchers said they did this , but the toxin did n't induce immunity to whooping cough .
14168	The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence .
14173	Experiments showed that the new , non-virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity , according to the researchers from the Selavo Research Center in Siena , Italy , the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and the Japanese National Institutes of Health .

14178	At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into West Germany 's financial center , the opening of a three-man office on a Frankfurt side street should n't attract much attention .
14180	After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall .
14183	In 1796 , Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London , Paris , Vienna and Naples to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century .
14184	The original bank in Frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild , and the family 's banking activities focused on London and Paris .
14189	Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II , the Rothschilds ' place in Frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the Rothschild name .
14191	The family was in Allied countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s .
14194	American journalist William L. Shirer , in his book `` The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , '' wrote of how in Vienna he had witnessed `` squads of -LCB- Nazi -RCB- SS men carting off silver , tapestries , paintings and other loot from the Rothschild palace . ''
14196	`` For a member of the Rothschild family , the return to Frankfurt is a very meaningful event , although it might not mean as much to German banking as it means to us , '' says Baron David de Rothschild , Elie 's younger cousin and a partner in Rothschild & Cie . Banque in Paris .
14198	`` It would be surprising if they did n't come to Frankfurt in time for 1992 , and they bring an interesting tradition .
14201	The new representative office , with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the Rothschild family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own .
14202	Instead , it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family 's mainstay banking units : N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. in London , Rothschild & Cie. in Paris and Rothschild Bank AG in Zurich .
14205	Each Rothschild bank is linked by family ties and cross-ownership .
14206	In March , N M Rothschild in London and Rothschild Bank in Zurich showed assets of # 4.1 billion -LRB- $ 6.51 billion -RRB- and 1.26 billion Swiss francs -LRB- $ 774 million -RRB- , respectively .
14208	In Europe , the Rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as European industry restructures ahead of 1992 .
14210	`` Obviously , there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide , '' concedes Baron David de Rothschild , `` but we feel we have some cards to play . ''
14211	Among them , he says , is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout Europe and beyond .
14212	The Rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors .
14214	`` But we do make exceptions , '' says a smiling Baron Elie de Rothschild , `` especially if they are very young and have very rich parents .
14216	The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures .
14217	A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index .
14218	Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves .
14219	The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . ''
14220	But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
14222	And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . ''
14224	And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies . ''
14228	While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks .
14229	When Chicago futures prices jump up or down , the New York Stock Exchange follows .
14234	`` I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing . ''
14235	Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility .
14237	`` The kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day .
14241	Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks .
14244	Louis Margolis , managing director in charge of equity options and futures at Salomon Inc. , says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures .
14247	Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says .
14250	For one thing , the Chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout -- including many friends in Congress .
14252	`` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader .
14253	`` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo . ''
14258	If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts .
14263	If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts .
14264	And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions .
14271	Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most .
14274	Of course , portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities .
14276	The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says .
14279	Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices .
14283	The European Community Commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between France 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds .
14284	Meeting in Strasbourg Wednesday , the commission voted , as expected , to formally object to the accord between Air France , the state-owned airline , and state-controlled domestic carrier Air Inter .
14286	At issue is an accord dating back to March in which Air France gained access to five domestic French routes under Air Inter 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of France under the flag of Air France .
14287	The two shared results from this route swap , and followed rules on ticket pricing .
14289	The airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections .
14291	An Air Inter spokesman said , `` Because they -LCB- the EC -RCB- have doubts , we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord .
14292	A state appellate court reinstated the 1987 convictions of Pymm Thermometer Corp. and two of its executives on charges of assault for exposing workers to toxic mercury vapors .
14293	The indictment charged that Pymm operated a machine to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom .
14295	The judge handling the case in state Supreme Court , a trial court , had tossed out the jury verdicts , ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules .
14298	Lawyers for the company and executives could n't be reached for comment .
14299	The executives face five to 15 years in prison and fines of $ 5,000 or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules .
14300	The company could be fined a maximum of $ 10,000 , or double the profit .
14302	GM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ 15 million worth of Jaguar shares but does n't own any yet , according to GM officials here and at the company 's Detroit headquarters .
14305	GM is close to completing a friendly deal with Jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual 30 % stake and joint manufacturing ventures .
14306	Speculative investors , betting on an imminent clash between Ford and GM , pushed up Jaguar 's share price five pence -LRB- eight U.S. cents -RRB- to a near-record 720 pence -LRB- $ 11.60 -RRB- in late trading on London 's stock exchange yesterday .
14313	`` I really do n't see the government doing something that Jaguar does n't want over the next 14 months , '' said Kenneth Warren , a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain 's House of Commons .
14314	`` The golden share is a single share , but it is the magic share . ''
14316	The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor , British or foreign .
14317	Ford is willing to bid for 100 % of Jaguar 's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely .
14318	As Jaguar 's biggest holder and Britain 's biggest car maker , Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early .
14319	Ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties .
14322	In wooing British lawmakers , GM has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep Jaguar British-owned and independent .
14323	This week , the U.S. auto giant paid for 10 House of Commons members and two House of Lords members to fly to Detroit and tour its operations there .
14327	The Conservatives do n't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry , where Jaguar has headquarters , nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain 's water and electricity industries .
14328	Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might , however , be receptive to any request by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for the restriction 's early removal to let GM amass more than 15 % or mount a friendly suitor bid against Ford .
14329	In the end , Sir John -- rather than the government or Jaguar shareholders -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share .
14330	Swedish rolling-steel and ball-bearing group AB SKF said its pretax profit rose 78 % to 1.78 billion kronor -LRB- $ 278 million -RRB- in the first nine months from one billion kronor -LRB- $ 156 million -RRB- in the corresponding period a year earlier .
14341	This may have been true 10 years ago , but times have changed , even in Utah .
14343	He has not changed , but those around him have .
14344	Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas , rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream , conservative Utahans .
14345	Recently , some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the Sierra Club , the League of Women Voters and the National Rifle Association joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound Central Utah Project .
14350	Furthermore , his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power-plant construction , coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment , but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the Wasatch Range into a ski resort .
14351	It astounds me he can rationalize his self-righteous and greedy actions in Utah .
14354	Mr. Redford , like it or not , is like a braking system on a runaway truck , kind of slowing it down into control .
14355	He 's rich , famous and intelligent , and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do .
14357	Personally , I 'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit takers , and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future , not caring about the long-range implications .
14365	Mr. Windsor , among other analysts connected to the conservative Heritage Foundation , fears the gathering of 18 leaders , mostly from Central American nations , will force Mr. Bush `` to explain and redeem himself '' in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega .
14366	At the same time , liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. Bush 's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in U.S. aid to the tiny country .
14370	`` We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side , '' said Rodrigo Sotela , an economic affairs specialist at the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington .
14371	Democrats argue that Costa Rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that Mr. Bush is attending the celebration this weekend : to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in Nicaragua .
14378	While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. Ortega , they insist that Mr. Bush wo n't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies .
14379	The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days , endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition , renewing the U.S. trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region .
14380	Officials also insist Mr. Bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region , fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries .
14382	`` There wo n't be any formal resolutions or communiques , I do n't think .
14385	A brief `` executive summary '' was issued last April , and attracted some , but not much , attention .
14386	More-detailed reports followed , and attracted even less notice .
14388	The sixth and last report now is out , and it puts the effort in perspective .
14391	The previous five reports were mainly statistical , but clear enough in outline .
14392	They showed that participants in Division I football and men 's basketball , the big-time `` revenue sports , '' entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than `` minor-sport '' jocks and students who participated in other extracurricular activities , and they got lower grades once they got there , at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them .
14393	The football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and homework combined -LRB- 30 hours a week versus 25.3 -RRB- .
14394	Almost half -LRB- 49.8 % -RRB- reported suffering `` mental abuse '' from coaches , and almost one-quarter -LRB- 24.8 % -RRB- said they had been pressured to ignore injuries .
14400	Here are a few of their answers : -- `` They say that I am a student-athlete , but really I 'm an athlete-student .
14410	-- `` The coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes -- not treat us like pieces of meat .
14411	They always say to get a degree first , but they do n't allow us time or to skip practice to study for a test .
14414	-- `` The pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence , such as punching and slapping by coaches .
14423	Time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with football -LRB- meetings , lifting weights , conditioning or films -RRB- .
14428	-- `` Physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my teammates ' lives '' .
14431	One has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part , not a whole , of the student-athlete 's life '' .
14433	-- `` Somehow , and I do n't know how , the game needs to be played for fun again , and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative TV contracts '' .
14436	The Knight Foundation , of Akron , Ohio , has established a national commission to look into college-sports reform , and the NCAA Presidents Commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half , moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to 25 games from 28 .
14438	NCAA Executive Director Richard Schultz , in accepting a place on the Knight Commission , urged that the panel take a `` balanced '' view , which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much , and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the NCAA 's full convention in January , which will vote on them .
14440	But the `` real world '' also includes the unpleasant truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have wooed and won .
14444	And like college radicals everywhere , they are talking about a demonstration -- where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands , classroom style .
14445	Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of Harvard University 's new Society of Nerds and Geeks , or SONG .
14446	SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they are n't going to take it anymore , at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first .
14447	`` We could have called ourselves the Academic Intellectual Society , but then everyone would have said , ` Oh , you mean the nerd-and-geek club , ' '' Leonid Fridman , SONG 's graduate-student adviser , told 19 attendees at the club 's inaugural meeting earlier this month .
14448	Membership has since swelled to between 20 and 25 .
14449	Some people may think of nerds as calculator-toting , socially awkward individuals with shirt-pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical .
14451	But SONG founder Jeremy Kahn , a Harvard junior , thinks of nerds and geeks more as `` nonconformists , '' albeit with a studious bent .
14453	The club plans to show nerdy movies , such as `` Real Genius , '' in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers ; and naturally , the `` Revenge of the Nerds , '' a tale of college males with runny noses and ill-fitting pants .
14454	One of its `` more ambitious goals '' is to get Jaime Escalante , the Los Angeles high-school mathematics teacher featured in the film `` Stand and Deliver , '' to come to Harvard for a guest lecture .
14455	Nerds and geeks sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at Harvard .
14458	`` I 'm a math major , but I want to know about psychobiology .
14463	Starpointe holders , who approved the plan last April , will receive $ 21 in cash a share , or a total $ 63 million .
14464	The FDIC cleared the move yesterday , and the banks must wait at least 30 days before closing the purchase .
14471	Lawrence B. Seidman , 41 years old , was named chairman of this savings and loan institution .
14472	He will succeed Charles L. Harrington , chairman and chief executive officer , who retired last month .
14475	William J. Russo was named senior vice president , public affairs and advertising , for this financial and travel services concern 's American Express Bank Ltd. subsidiary .
14476	Mr. Russo , 38 years old , previously was first vice president , public affairs and advertising , at the banking unit .
14478	In the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill in March , new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in Alaska .
14479	At the same time , moves toward tighter air-quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do n't pollute as much as fuel refined from `` heavy '' crudes , generally high in sulfur .
14481	So the scramble is on for lighter crudes globally , and for natural gas in the U.S. .
14482	Recently Saudi Arabia and Venezuela , traditional heavy-crude producers , have boasted of new finds of light , low-sulfur oil by their national oil companies .
14498	A huge production system built in the sea off Santa Barbara and ashore is sitting idle .
14500	More than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas , partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a fuel that is cleaner to burn than either oil or coal .
14503	`` We could have sat on it longer , but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace , '' says Richard Poole , senior scout for Santa Fe International .
14508	The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika , Mikhail Gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy .
14509	They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices , breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business .
14510	They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation , and recommend ways to soften the social consequences .
14511	While many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed , the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high-level authorship .
14512	Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta , Soviet sources say the article was written by Leonid Abalkin and a small group of colleagues .
14513	Mr. Abalkin , head of the Academy of Science 's Institute of Economics , was recently appointed deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform .
14516	For example , the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. Gorbachev in 1987 and later dropped .
14518	Seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who demand overnight solutions , the article advocates what it calls a `` radical-moderate approach . ''
14519	The document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month , and will probably be presented to the Soviet Parliament for consideration this year .
14521	The authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that `` quick and easy paths to success simply do n't exist . ''
14526	The document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish , helped by tough anti-monopoly legislation .
14527	The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992 , including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders , cooperatives and joint ventures .
14529	Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform .
14532	By the end of next year , all loss-making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives .
14533	Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of 1991 .
14537	A genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid , centralized system .
14538	Departing from decades of Soviet dogma , the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment .
14539	To cushion the blows , the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits .
14541	The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled , and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade .
14542	Consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices , but luxury and imported items , including food , would be sold at market prices .
14543	Wholesale prices would be divided into three categories : raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels ; government-set procurement prices for a small number of key products ; and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers .
14544	Inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer unduly .
14546	The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further .
14547	Soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad .
14549	Alongside the current non-convertible ruble , a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other Western currencies .
14551	The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans : the State Planning Committee , known as Gosplan , and the State Committee for Material Supply , or Gossnab .
14552	But it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes , particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies , take effect .
14553	Ready , Willing and Unable I always lift the hood When my car does n't start ; If gadgets at home do n't work I coolly take them apart .
14554	I 'll admit there 's nothing wrong That I ever do find , But it 's nice when people say I appear mechanically inclined .
14562	Albert Engelken and Robert Thomson had never met , though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world .
14563	Mr. Engelken , now a transit-association executive in Washington , D.C. , and Mr. Thomson , a paper-products salesman in Montvale , N.J. , had n't even talked to each other .
14565	Mr. Engelken , a rabid baseball fan , pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of `` my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players . ''
14566	He often groans , he says , at the `` clutter '' of sports stories about drugs , alcohol , gambling and some player 's lament `` about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game . ''
14567	His morning paper , the Washington Post , even carries a sports column called `` Jurisprudence '' that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers .
14569	But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes , and about what Babe Ruth , Mr. Engelken reminds us , once called `` the only real game in the world . ''
14572	It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants -LRB- the predecessor to the San Francisco Giants scheduled to play in tonight 's world series -RRB- .
14573	Baseball fans throughout New York had sweated out a long summer with their teams , and now it had come to this : a battle between the two for the National League pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game , no less .
14574	Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands , and shouted at the top of their lungs .
14578	`` The Giants got swamped in the second game , 100 , and trailed 4-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game .
14579	The Giants scored once and had runners on second -LCB- Whitey Lockman -RCB- and third -LCB- Clint Hartung -RCB- as Bobby Thomson advanced to the plate . ''
14584	He wound up and let loose a fastball .
14585	The pitch sailed toward Bobby Thomson high and inside and then , with a crack of the bat , was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands .
14589	There ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that Bobby Thomson homer , who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous Russ Hodges radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with Mr. Hodges shouting , over and over , `` The Giants win the pennant , the Giants win the pennant ! ''
14590	Mr. Engelken and Mr. Thomson drifted in different directions in the subsequent years , and the Polo Grounds , located under Coogan 's Bluff in upper Manhattan , was replaced by a public-housing project .
14591	Mr. Thomson played outfield and third base until 1960 , posting a lifetime .270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales .
14592	Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington , but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951 .
14598	The family license plate reads `` ENG 23 , '' the first three letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- Bobby Thomson 's uniform number .
14599	And on Mr. Engelken 's 40th birthday , his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. Thomson to be autographed .
14603	On her husband 's 50th birthday -LRB- after an auspicious 23 years of marriage , it should be noted -RRB- , Betsy , Al and their college-bound son set out for New York to visit Fordham University .
14607	At the appointed exit , the family pulled over , and Mrs. Engelken went to get her papers .
14608	Mr. Engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window .
14610	She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname :
14615	Keep your Thomas Jeffersons , or St. Augustines or Michelangelos ; I 'd take baseball 's Flying Scot without hesitation . ''
14623	His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca `` a very fine pitcher . ''
14625	In an interview , Mr. Thomson , who is married and has three grown children , says he has few ties to baseball these days , other than playing old-timers games now and again .
14627	His mail regularly recalls `` my one event , '' and has been growing in recent years .
14628	In response to the letters , Mr. Thomson usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note , and rarely arranges a rendezvous .
14633	My mind was miles north at a place called Coogan 's Bluff , where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it .
14640	Analysts said the announcement , the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves , is aimed at improving Southam 's earnings before the expiration in June of a standstill pact with Torstar Corp .
14641	When that agreement expires , Torstar will be free to increase its 22.4 % stake in Southam , or to make an offer for the whole company .
14643	The newspaper could fetch between 15 million and 20 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 12.8 million to $ 17.1 million -RRB- , said one analyst , who asked not to be identified .
14644	A spokesman for Southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses , which most analysts place at between C$ 4 million and C$ 7 million .
14646	`` To be profitable , the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking , '' said John Macfarlane , the paper 's publisher .
14648	The acquisition of the Financial Times of Canada is `` well within reach for any number of media companies , both public and private , '' said James Cole , an analyst with Toronto-based BBN James Capel Inc .
14649	Possible bidders include Christopher Ondaatje , a Toronto financier and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp Inc. , a holding company controlled by Toronto 's Bronfman family .
14650	Mr. Ondaatje sold his stake in Pagurian Corp. to Hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition .
14651	Mr. Ondaatje could n't be reached for comment , but Roy Mac-Laren , chairman of CB Media , a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines , said his company would take a close look at the newspaper .
14654	This year , it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales , while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas .
14656	Norton Co. said net income for the third quarter fell 6 % to $ 20.6 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 22 million , or $ 1.03 a share .
14657	Operating profit for the abrasives , engineering materials and petroleum services concern was $ 19.2 million , or 91 cents a share , up 3 % from $ 18.7 million , or 87 cents a share .
14663	Norton and Texas Eastern had each held a 50 % stake in Eastman in a joint venture .
14664	Norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of Eastman Christensen .
14665	For the nine months , Norton had net of $ 81.2 million , or $ 3.87 a share , and a tax credit of $ 4.4 million .
14666	In the year-earlier period , the company had net of $ 77.2 million , or $ 3.68 a share , and a tax credit of $ 7.7 million .
14667	Norton had operating profit of $ 76.8 million , or $ 3.66 a share , up 11 % from $ 69.5 million , or $ 3.31 a share .
14669	Y.J. Park and her family scrimped for four years to buy a tiny apartment here , but found that the closer they got to saving the $ 40,000 they originally needed , the more the price rose .
14673	`` It 's all I think about or talk about . ''
14674	For the Parks and millions of other young Koreans , the long-cherished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion .
14676	Last May , a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem .
14679	The panel found that since 1987 , real-estate prices rose nearly 50 % in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity , the 1988 Seoul Olympics and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop Korea 's southwest .
14682	In 1987 , a quarter of the population owned 91 % of the nation 's 71,895 square kilometers of private land , the report said , and 10 % of the population owned 65 % of the land devoted to housing .
14687	In fact , during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the Land Bureau is housed , and at the National Assembly , demanding the government put a stop to real-estate speculation .
14691	Highlights of the bills , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own , to 660 square meters in the nation 's six largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural areas .
14692	The government will penalize offenders , but wo n't confiscate property .
14693	-- A tax of between 3 % and 6 % on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling .
14694	-- Taxes of between 15 % and 50 % a year on `` excessive '' profits from the resale of property , or the sale of idle land to the government .
14697	The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of President Roh .
14698	But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea 's renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home .
14699	Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots .
14700	The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based .
14701	But others , large landowners , real-estate developers and business leaders , say the government 's proposals are intolerable .
14702	Led by the Federation of Korean Industries , the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties .
14703	Government officials who are urging real-estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure .
14706	The land available for housing construction stands at about 46.2 square meters a person -- 18 % lower than in Taiwan and only about half that of Japan .
14708	The chief culprits , he says , are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land `` not for their corporate use , but for resale at huge profit . ''
14709	One research institute calculated that as much as 67 % of corporate-owned land is held by 403 companies -- and that as little as 1.5 % of that is used for business .
14710	The government 's Office of Bank Supervision and Examination told the National Assembly this month that in the first half of 1989 , the nation 's 30 largest business groups bought real estate valued at $ 1.5 billion .
14713	Banks , investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to 50 % of their capital -- currently the proportion is 75 % .
14715	But Mrs. Park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation , apartment prices are unlikely to go down .
14720	Although profits were `` squeezed '' in 1989 , mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs , the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond .
14728	Greg Smith , Moon Township manager , said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing `` the character and flavor of the neighborhood . ''
14731	Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade , but it has not been sufficiently effective , because , unfortunately , it came too late .
14732	Ten years ago , the newspaper El Espectador , of which my brother Guillermo was editor , began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders ' aspirations to control Colombian politics , especially the Congress .
14733	Then , when it would have been easier to resist them , nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago .
14735	The censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination .
14737	Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota , destroying a major part of its installations and equipment .
14738	And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed , and its installations destroyed .
14739	Journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets .
14740	Distribution centers are bombed , and advertisers are intimidated .
14742	If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world .
14744	The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country .
14746	I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan .
14748	All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs .
14752	Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities , and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized .
14753	More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports , and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated .
14754	The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons , explosives and other war-like materiel .
14755	Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but , on the other hand , none of the key drug barons have been captured .
14759	Drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars , airplanes , launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed .
14760	But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia .
14767	Our coffee growers face reductions in their income , and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee .
14769	A just price and an open market for what Colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the U.S. .
14771	Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge .
14776	Its tax base is shrinking , a $ 1 billion budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year .
14778	When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins .
14779	Running the nation 's largest and most ornery city may be no treat , but at least Mr. Dinkins knows what to expect from it .
14786	They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cronies who may seek a place at the trough .
14787	They wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis , and they wonder who will be advising him .
14788	Will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies , who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings , or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign ?
14790	But Mr. Dinkins has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted kidnapper , and over his handling of a stock sale to his son .
14791	Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. Dinkins 's support among Jewish voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points .
14792	In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty .
14793	`` A lot of people think I will give away the store , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says .
14795	The city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair .
14796	Renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly .
14799	Mr. Koch already has announced he will drop 3,200 jobs from the city payroll , but that wo n't be enough .
14801	If elected , Mr. Dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods .
14803	`` His supporters are not venal , but their solution to everything will be to spend more money , and he wo n't have any money . ''
14804	By and large , Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore .
14805	Instead of focusing on the financial future , Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch .
14806	`` The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people , '' says Meyer Frucher , a real-estate executive and former aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo .
14809	He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody .
14810	More important , he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst .
14813	But even in his front-runner campaign , he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor .
14816	He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke .
14821	A former U.S. Marine , Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s , linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel , Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton , and getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965 .
14824	Later , Mr. Dinkins became more deeply indebted to Mr. Sutton and other city pols , including then-City Council President Paul O'Dwyer , when they helped him get appointed city clerk , a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau , among other things .
14827	Mr. Sutton recalls : `` When I left , I sat down with Charlie -LCB- Rangel -RCB- , Basil -LCB- Paterson -RCB- and David , and David said , ` Who will run for borough president ? ' And I said , ` You will . ' ''
14831	But by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's Board of Estimate , the body that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters .
14832	Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
14837	Says one city official : `` Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal .
14840	`` I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind , '' Mr. Ferrer admits , but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of Mr. Dinkins and that he backs the Democratic candidate enthusiastically .
14841	Mr. Dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff , Bill Lynch , denies that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues .
14848	That announcement was roundly criticized by Mayor Koch -- who has endorsed Mr. Dinkins -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ 5 million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under Mr. Dinkins 's proposal .
14853	And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of New York City .
14856	Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , an industry organization , says Mr. Dinkins 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable . ''
14857	Mr. Dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists , leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential .
14859	A disheveled , roly-poly son of a Long Island potato farmer , Mr. Lynch is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward Kennedy and Mr. Jackson .
14864	Mr. Dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include American Express Co. chairman James D. Robinson III , investment banker Felix Rohatyn , leveraged-buy-out specialist Reginald Lewis and attorney Joseph Flom .
14865	Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. Dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background .
14866	Names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate Richard Ravitch , former schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola and Messrs. Leventhal and Gliedman .
14867	Then there are Mr. Dinkins 's old-time Harlem colleagues , such as U.S. Rep. Rangel , former Deputy Mayor Paterson and Mr. Sutton .
14868	Having attained positions of real influence or wealth , these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics ; they are less confrontational than the younger , more activist black political community that has been based largely in Brooklyn .
14869	-LRB- Part of Mr. Dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the Brooklyn and Harlem factions . -RRB-
14875	`` I will sit down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ? Uh-uh , '' he says with a shake of the head .
14877	The former U.S. attorney , who prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives , has succeeded in raising questions about Mr. Dinkins 's ethical standards , but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy .
14881	`` The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy , '' says Malcolm Hoenlein , a Jewish community leader .
14888	The petite , 29-year-old Ms. Johnson , dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain , is a claims adjuster with Aetna Life & Casualty .
14889	She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday , when an army of adjusters , employed by major insurers , invaded the San Francisco area to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives .
14890	Equipped with cellular telephones , laptop computers , calculators and a pack of blank checks , they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters , buy food , replace lost clothing , repair broken water heaters , and replaster walls .
14891	Some of the funds will used to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction .
14897	Once inside , she spends nearly four hours measuring and diagramming each room in the 80-year-old house , gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it .
14898	She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls .
14899	While she works inside , a tenant returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing .
14900	One of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the kitchen .
14901	Others grab books , records , photo albums , sofas and chairs , working frantically in the fear that an aftershock will jolt the house again .
14902	The owners , William and Margie Hammack , are luckier than many others .
14904	Only about 20 % of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage .
14908	`` It 's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through , but you have to .
14910	For Aetna and other insurers , the San Francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched .
14912	Aetna , which has nearly 3,000 adjusters , had deployed about 750 of them in Charlotte , Columbia , and Charleston .
14916	Since commercial airline flights were disrupted , the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the West Coast and bring along portable computers , cellular phones and some claims adjusters .
14920	He returned home last Thursday , packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty Friday in Walnut Creek .
14921	Offices were set up in San Francisco and San Jose .
14922	In a few instances , Aetna knew it would probably be shelling out big bucks , even before a client called or faxed in a claim .
14926	Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms , balconies , fireplaces , chimneys , microwaves and dishwashers .
14927	But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors , wallcoverings , roofing and siding , to come up with a total value for a house .
14929	Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting , plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country , adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it .
14932	The house itself , located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double-decker highway Interstate 880 , was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement .
14935	Many of the adjusters employed by Aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry .
14937	Four years ago , she was managing a film-processing shop and was totally bored .
14939	She signed up , starting as an `` inside '' adjuster , who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone .
14941	She spent a month at an Aetna school in Gettysburg , Pa. , learning all about the construction trade , including masonry , plumbing and electrical wiring .
14942	That was followed by three months at the Aetna Institute in Hartford , where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies .
14947	As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house after winding up her chores there , the house begins to creak and sway .
14949	It is an aftershock , one of about 2,000 since the earthquake , and it makes her uneasy .
14950	The next day , as she prepares a $ 10,000 check for the Hammacks , which will cover the cost of demolishing the house and clearing away the debris , she jumps at the slightest noise .
14953	They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor , but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside .
14957	The adjuster had n't completed all the calculations , but says : `` We 're talking policy limits . ''
14961	`` And you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance , '' says Mrs. Hammack , reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand .
14962	Earthquake insurance costs about $ 2 to $ 4 annually for every $ 1,000 of value , and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe .
14970	The apartment she shares with a 12-year-old daughter and her sister was rattled , books and crystal hit the floor , but nothing was severely damaged .
14973	Last Sunday , Ms. Johnson finally got a chance to water her plants , but stopped abruptly .
14976	The Federal Communications Commission allowed American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market .
14977	The FCC moves were good news for AT&T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation .
14990	Apart from those two actions , Mr. Sikes and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how AT&T is regulated since competition has increased .
14993	`` The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the New York telecommunications firm said in a statement .
14998	Separately , AT&T filed a countersuit against MCI accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising .
15006	In the past two months the nation 's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $ 6 billion -- more than 15 % of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares , Dalbar says .
15008	Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments , Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm the trend .
15009	Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ 500 million , or about 13 % of their junk fund assets , in the past two months .
15011	`` People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out , ' '' says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer & Janachowski , a San Francisco investment adviser .
15016	Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government-bond funds .
15025	`` You get a news item , it hits , you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal , '' says Mr. Litvack .
15037	Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19 , Lipper says ; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 % .
15038	People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again , some analysts and fund specialists say .
15039	Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues , such as RJR Nabisco , to raise cash to meet expected redemptions .
15042	Says Michael Hirsch , chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York : `` It 's a time bomb just waiting to go off .
15046	Mr. Lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .
15047	Indeed , only hours earlier , Mrs. Thatcher had called Mr. Lawson 's economic policies `` sound '' and said she has `` always supported '' him .
15050	Graham Beale , manager of foreign-exchange operations at Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York , added that Mrs. Thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline .
15053	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8400 marks , up from 1.8353 marks late Wednesday , and at 142.10 yen , up from 141.52 yen late Wednesday .
15057	Mr. Foley of Lloyds noted that Mr. Lawson 's replacement , John Major , the British foreign minister , will take time to establish his credibility and , in the meantime , sterling could trend downward in volatile trade .
15060	Unless Mr. Lawson 's resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy -- Mrs. Thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System 's exchange-rate mechanism , Mr. Lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates , Mr. Chandross concluded .
15061	Also announcing his resignation Thursday was Alan Walters , Mrs. Thatcher 's economic adviser and Mr. Lawson 's nemesis .
15063	The Fed 's move , however , only proved a stopgap to the pound 's slide and the Fed intervened for a second time at around $ 1.5825 , according to New York traders .
15073	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
15075	Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated , shelf offering of $ 200 million of debt securities , via Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman , Sachs & Co .
15076	First Brands Corp. , proposed offering of 6,475,000 common shares , of which 1,475,000 common shares will be sold by the company and five million shares by holders , via First Boston Corp. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd .
15077	Home Nutritional Services Inc. , a wholly owned subsidiary of Healthdyne Inc. , proposed initial offering of four million common shares , of which 1.8 million will be sold by Home Nutritional Services and 2.2 million will be sold by Healthdyne , via Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
15078	Parametric Technology Corp. , initial public offering of 1.7 million common shares , of which 1,365,226 will be offered by the company and 334,774 will be offered by holders , via Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. , Hambrecht & Quist Inc. and Wessels , Arnold & Henderson .
15079	SynOptics Communications Inc. , proposed public offering of 1.5 million common shares , of which 1,003,884 shares are to be sold by the company and 496,116 shares are to be sold by holders , via Morgan Stanley & Co. and Hambrecht & Quist .
15083	`` I agree , it 's ridiculous , '' says Mr. Boren , and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the U.S. decides to take -- or rather , not to take -- covert action .
15085	But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying .
15086	The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council .
15094	`` Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine , '' Mr. Boren says , referring as well to Sam Rayburn , the Democratic House speaker who cooperated with President Eisenhower .
15104	Mr. Boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month , but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes .
15114	Elliott Abrams , a veteran of intelligence committee debates , doubts that even Grenada or the Libyan raid would have taken place if `` consensus '' had been required .
15115	Vandenberg and Rayburn were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents ; modern senators , Mr. Boren notwithstanding , are less modest .
15122	He figures the episode will help `` clarify any ambiguities '' between the committee and administration .
15129	The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power .
15135	We lived in rural areas many years , but now live in St. Louis County , Mo .
15136	This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey , I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening .
15137	The presence of so many people , cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live .
15139	I remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long-established , stake-holding residents , and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging , `` safe '' ways of thought and action .
15140	I remembered being fired at age 44 , with five children at home , when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid , small-town employer .
15142	Now , I revel in the freedom , culture , activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects .
15144	So after all , even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce , rural virtues thought to exist amid fields , forests and country lanes .
15146	Finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of Waertsilae Marine Oy , a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week , amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be averted .
15152	The second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991 .
15153	One analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule , but that Carnival may have to pay up to 25 % more to get the second and third ships .
15157	However , some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway 's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago .
15158	In that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees .
15163	At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae , a conglomerate , the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation .
15164	Under the rescue plan , Waertsilae sold 51 % of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds .
15165	The government , in turn , guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board .
15166	Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure Finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation .
15167	The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute .
15168	After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working capital .
15169	But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial condition , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn .
15170	People familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine .
15173	Noting that Sweden wound up wasting state subsidies of about 35 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 5.47 billion -RRB- during the 1970s in a vain attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry , one analyst suggested that Mr. Suominen may have decided to cut Finland 's losses once and for all .
15178	Indeed , the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change tack and agree to pick up the bill , analysts said .
15181	The cable programmer said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties , and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just-completed $ 1.6 billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries .
15182	A Turner spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on the quarter 's earnings , but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for 1989 .
15183	The company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt , and the outstanding Class A cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of Cable News Network , was made possible by an offering of about $ 750 million of debentures and notes and $ 900 million in bank borrowings .
15184	The offering included $ 550 million of 12 % senior subordinated debentures due 2001 and $ 200 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004 .
15185	The notes were priced to yield 8 % and are convertible into the company 's Class B common stock at a price which represents a 15 % premium over the market price on Oct. 10 , 1989 .
15190	The closing will affect about 3,000 workers and eliminate production of 700 cars .
15191	The assembly plant builds the Cadillac DeVille , Chevrolet Caprice and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Wagon .
15193	The plant builds chassis for recreational vehicles and about 450 workers will be affected by the closing .
15195	The nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 147,121 vehicles this week , down 9.6 % from the 162,767 a year ago , but 2.5 % higher than last week 's 143,534 .
15196	Ford Motor Co. slated overtime again this week at its Wixom , Mich. ; Wayne , Mich. ; Kansas City , Mo. , and Norfolk , Va. , assembly plants .
15197	They build the Lincoln Town Car , Continental and Mark VII , the Ford Escort and full-sized pickup trucks .
15198	Chrysler Corp. scheduled overtime this week at its St. Louis Assembly Plant No. 2 , Newark , Del. , and Sterling Heights , Mich. , assembly plants .
15199	They build extended minivans and the Dodge Spirit , Acclaim , Shadow and Sundance .
15202	f - Includes Chevrolet Prizm and Toyota Corolla .
15206	`` The last thing markets like is uncertainty , '' said Ian Harwood , chief economist at S.G. Warburg & Co. , of the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and chief economic adviser Sir Alan Walters .
15207	`` I think you 'll see share prices go down , and sterling now is under something of a cloud . ''
15211	At 15 % , base interest rates are the highest in eight years , and the 7.6 % annual inflation rate is by far the highest in the European Community .
15220	Red ink already has begun to flow in the wake of the U.S.-U.K. market breaks of Oct. 13 and Oct. 16 .
15221	London-based LIT Holdings , the largest financer of traders in the Chicago options and futures markets , said yesterday it will incur a second-half loss as a result of the market plunge .
15230	`` People in the stock market were very much Thatcher 's children -- very young and wealthy optimists .
15237	The mergers and acquisitions market has been a saving grace for the industry , but uncertainties are beginning to mount even there .
15241	But he adds : `` Everybody and his sister have opened up M&A shops .
15244	At the others , there are going to be a lot of disappointments , after all those promises and all that big money that 's been paid to people . ''

15256	SYDNEY-Qintex Australia Ltd. , under pressure from bank lenders , has called in accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company .
15261	Yesterday , Mr. Skase said the company is `` solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments . ''
15266	Last Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , its 43%-owned U.S. TV production and distribution affiliate , filed for Chapter 11 protection .
15269	The issue has come to a boil in Newark , N.J. , where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted , the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees .
15271	In those cases , the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes , including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment .
15273	A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs .
15274	`` The people who suffer in the short run are defendants , but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people , because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights , '' says Gerald Lefcourt , a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures .
15275	Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark , where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges .
15276	Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law , or RICO , the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial .
15281	Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter .
15283	Mr. Alito said his office `` just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . ''
15284	Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
15286	Through his lawyers , Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others .
15287	The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits .
15288	Mr. Antar , the SEC said , made more than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987 .
15291	Still , criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees .
15295	In general , markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances .
15296	But there are times when they seize up , and panicky sellers can not find buyers .
15298	As the market tumbled , disorderly market conditions prevailed : The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be executed ; and many specialists stopped trading altogether .
15299	These failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages : Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin-calls triggered additional selling pressures .
15301	His skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy-sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control .
15303	After the 1987 crash , and as a result of the recommendations of many studies , `` circuit breakers '' were devised to allow market participants to regroup and restore orderly market conditions .
15308	The Fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign-exchange markets .
15310	The stock market is the only major market without a market-maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort .
15312	In 1987 , it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window .
15313	It lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses .
15314	They , in turn , lent money to their customers -- who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares .
15316	But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ?
15317	Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole .
15319	The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .
15322	The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange , the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion .
15327	It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level .
15328	The Fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks .
15329	It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell IBM or General Motors shares .
15331	The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices .
15334	Disorderly market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s .
15344	`` It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general , to say nothing of banks , if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions . ''
15348	However , in light of the risks involved in such transactions , banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions , he said .
15349	In other comments , he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy .
15351	Intel Corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts , but the `` bugs '' are n't expected to hurt Intel and most computer makers .
15352	Computer experts familiar with the flaws , found in Intel 's 80486 chip , say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their `` brains '' appear on the market sometime next year .
15355	But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them .
15359	Likewise , AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of 486-based machines .
15362	Nonetheless , concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel 's stock to $ 32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading , on volume of 3,609,800 shares , and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq 's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday .
15365	Intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week .
15367	What 's more , the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations , he said , and then very seldom .
15369	The bugs will cause problems in `` specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications '' such as word-processing and spreadsheets , said Michael Slater , editor of the Microprocessor Report , an industry newsletter .
15370	Sun , Hewlett-Packard and others say Intel is n't wholly to blame for the snafu .
15372	`` The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability , '' said Hewlett-Packard 's Mr. Archuleta .
15373	`` You can do that but you 're taking a risk .
15376	An IBM spokeswoman said the company told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product .
15377	IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the spokeswoman said , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays .
15383	Intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines .
15387	Intel clocks the chip 's speed at 15 million instructions per second , or MIPs .
15389	Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers , which connect groups of computers together , and in computer-aided design .
15392	-LRB- A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer , 32-bit chips . -RRB-
15393	Since then , Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips , all of which can run software written for previous models .
15395	Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines , which are expected to reach the market early next year .
15406	Wall Street analysts have criticized Bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones .
15410	Bethlehem had little choice but to go with a European steelmaker , because its competitors already have tapped the Japanese and South Korean industry leaders , analysts noted .
15411	Under terms of the agreement , Usinor 's Chavanne-Ketin unit and Bethlehem would establish a modernized facility to make cast-iron mill rolls at the company 's cast-iron shop here .
15413	The Usinor unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin caster by early next fall .
15414	The caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls , which are basically huge rolling pins used to flatten or shape steel products .
15415	Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union to consolidate BethForge 's two machine shops and four heat-treatment facilities of the press-forge operations .
15416	Once the consolidation is complete , Bethlehem plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication , hardened steel and large-diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom-die applications .
15422	Well , when Congress in its recent S&L bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by 1994 , it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made .
15424	As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know , there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need to `` encourage '' long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed obsession with the short term .
15425	Now , we regard this as a largely phony issue , but the `` long term '' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway .
15426	It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value .
15431	I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court , through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies .
15433	Healthy thrifts such as Columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky .
15438	As part of its restructuring several years ago , Exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor Rockefeller Center skyscraper to a Japanese company .
15439	But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies .
15440	Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left .
15441	New York authorities , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it .
15442	`` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said Stanley Grayson , New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development .
15444	City officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in , but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name `` Everglades . ''
15446	Dallas , its economy based on oil and real estate , has been in a slump .
15449	Las Colinas , once a huge Texas ranch , is a sprawling complex of office buildings , homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years .
15451	The company wo n't say how much it will save , but during at its interim location , sources say it will likely pay rent of $ 10 to $ 15 per square foot .
15453	In Texas , taxes and development costs are also lower , they said .
15454	Plus , one Exxon official said , by eliminating the typically long New York commutes between office and home , management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in Dallas , rather than a 35-hour work week in New York .
15456	The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association , an industry group , said Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September , compared with 527,000 metric tons a year earlier .
15457	Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products .
15458	The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill .
15460	The September 87 % operating rate compared with a rate of 101 % in August but was unchanged from a year earlier .
15462	IMA Holdings Corp. completed its $ 3 billion acquisition of American Medical International Inc. , purchasing 63 million shares , or 86 % , of the Los Angeles-based health-care services concern for $ 26.50 a share .
15464	IMA is a group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago through the leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray Melvyn Klein & Partners .
15465	Harry J. Gray and Melvyn N. Klein , along with five other IMA designees , were named to join American Medical 's 10-member board .
15466	The completion of the merger agreement follows months of twists and turns .
15467	In January , American Medical brought in a new chief executive officer , Richard A. Gilleland , 45 , who will remain as chairman , president and chief executive .
15468	A few days later , American Medical announced sharply lower earnings , taking charges of $ 24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases .
15473	It received more offers , but the auction was surprisingly won by IMA , which bid $ 28 a share and asked Mr. Gilleland to stay on as an equity participant .
15477	But they never materialized and IMA completed the purchase yesterday .
15478	Other new board members include John S. Harrison and Mark A. Adley of First Boston , James F. Lyons , William S. Goldberg and Harold S. Handelsman .
15479	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis .
15483	But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
15486	`` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. Brady said .
15487	Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract .
15488	Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility .
15489	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures stood at $ 10,000 a contract for speculators and $ 5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16 , 1987 ; that day the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 .
15490	Margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19 , 1987 .
15491	Currently , they stand at $ 12,000 for speculators , who are typically individuals and non-member traders , and $ 6,000 for hedgers , which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks .
15495	Mr. Brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility , and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks .
15496	But he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds .
15497	The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading , which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago .
15500	That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets .
15501	The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't .
15502	Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
15506	The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy -LRB- D. , Vt. -RRB- , Richard Lugar -LRB- R. , Ind. -RRB- , and Bob Kerrey -LRB- D. , Neb. -RRB- , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated .
15507	These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance .
15508	The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct .
15509	Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry .
15510	Indeed , some of the bill 's requirements , including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges .
15511	Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges , the industry and ultimately the general public .
15522	In fact , several London markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts .
15523	The U.S. exchanges need both market integrity and cost-efficiency ; long-term growth depends on it .
15525	The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of `` service fees , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets .
15526	Other provisions have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges .
15527	These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages .
15529	One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct .
15530	Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances .
15532	In an already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public , depriving the private individual of access to the markets .
15535	Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers .
15536	This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers .
15538	Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue .
15539	In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure .
15540	The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
15542	All U.S. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .
15543	Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are .
15546	That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications , positive and negative , of the proposed resolutions to those problems , and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades .
15547	Mr. Nastro is chairman of the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York and director of commodity administration at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
15549	The number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % .
15550	Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier .
15552	On the hungry streets of Naguib Mahfouz 's Cairo , life is nasty , brutish and wickedly entertaining .
15553	Zaita the `` cripple-maker '' rearranges the limbs of aspiring beggars -- and takes a cut of every cent they cadge .
15554	Hassan Kamel Ali is a card shark and dope dealer who has a simple creed : `` I live in this world , assuming that there is no morality , God or police . ''
15555	For the killer and thief , Said Mahran , fame flows from the barrel of a gun .
15557	Mr. Mahfouz 's Cairo also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God , not crime , for their salvation .
15558	But it is his portrait of Cairo low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts , of streets filled with `` dust , vegetable litter , and animal dung '' -- that made his reputation , and won him the Nobel Prize in 1988 .
15559	Three novels , `` The Beginning and the End '' -LRB- 412 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , `` The Thief and the Dogs '' -LRB- 158 pages , $ 16.95 -RRB- , and `` Wedding Song '' -LRB- 174 pages , $ 16.95 -RRB- , recently published by Doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old Mr. Mahfouz 's talent .
15560	But they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism , protest and allegory .
15563	`` The Beginning and the End , '' easily the best of the three , belongs to Mr. Mahfouz 's `` realistic '' period and it is the one for which he is most renowned .
15564	Published in 1949 , it follows the decline of a Cairo family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to Dickens , Balzac and Galsworthy .
15565	A minor bureaucrat dies suddenly , dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace .
15568	The real tragedy , though , lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances .
15574	We see , smell and hear slums filled with `` the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language , rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street . ''
15575	And we meet engaging crooks , such as Hassan `` the Head , '' famed for his head-butting fights , his whoring and his hashish .
15577	Hassan comes to a bad end , but so does almost everyone else in the book .
15579	Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic , and he modeled his work on Western classics .
15581	But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible , as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens 's London or Dostoevski 's St. Petersburg .
15582	`` The Thief and the Dogs , '' written in 1961 , is a taut , psychological drama , reminiscent of `` Crime and Punishment . ''
15583	Its antihero , Said Mahran , is an Egyptian Raskolnikov who seeks nobility in robbing and killing .
15584	`` I am the hope and the dream , the redemption of cowards , '' he says in one of many interior monologues .
15587	By 1961 , Mr. Mahfouz 's idealism had vanished or become twisted , as it has in Said .
15588	His giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets '' by punishing the `` real robbers '' -- the rich `` dogs '' who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents , and eventually to his own .
15590	Here , the city is dark and laden with symbolism : Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society .
15591	While the theme is compelling , the plot and characters are not .
15592	We never care about Said or the `` hypocrites '' he hunts .
15593	`` The Thief and the Dogs '' is a pioneering work , the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic , but it is likely to disappoint Western readers .
15594	The 1981 novel `` Wedding Song '' also is experimental , and another badly aimed bullet .
15595	The story of a playwright 's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues , in the manner of Faulkner 's `` The Sound and the Fury . ''
15597	Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art , and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world .
15599	The indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the Arab world .
15600	Mr. Mahfouz has been pilloried and censored for questioning Islam and advocating peace with Israel .
15604	The clutter of the 1940s remains , but its color has drained away , and the will to overcome has been defeated .
15606	Characters complain ceaselessly about food queues , prices and corruption .
15607	And the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man who gripes : `` Only government ministers can afford it these days ! ''
15608	Having lost their faith in God , in social reform and in opium , Cairenes are left with nothing but their sense of humor .
15610	Norwood Partners Limited Partnership of Boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of Phoenix Technologies Ltd. 's common shares .
15614	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Norwood said it 's part of a group that holds 525,546 Phoenix Technologies common shares , or a 5.3 % stake .
15615	Norwood has made `` no detailed plans , '' but it has engaged in talks with other shareholders , the filing said .
15617	Norwood is controlled by Daniel L. Barnett and Paul A. Reese , both officers of Boston-based Oasis Capital Management Inc. , a small Boston money management firm .
15620	Weirton Steel Corp. said it reached a tentative agreement on a 48-month labor contract with the Independent Steelworkers Union covering production and maintenance employees .
15622	The tentative agreement provides for wage increases of 85 cents an hour retroactive to Sept. 25 , 1989 , and for increases of 19 cents , 70 cents and 35 cents an hour effective Jan. 1 , 1991 , 1992 and 1993 , respectively .
15623	It also provides for benefit adjustments , including a partial restoration of vacations and holidays , as well as work-rule changes to increase productivity .
15629	After one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN , the House voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $ 28.4 million in spending for a New Jersey arts center , a Michigan library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during Sam Pierce 's tenure .
15630	HUD has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects , none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them .
15635	The 40 pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for HUD and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions .
15637	They are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken .
15640	They transferred some $ 28 million from the Community Development Block Grant program designated largely for low - and moderate-income projects and funneled it into such items as : -- $ 1.2 million for a performing-arts center in Newark , -- $ 1.3 million for `` job retention '' in Hawaiian sugar mills . -- $ 400,000 for a collapsing utility tunnel in Salisbury , -- $ 500,000 for `` equipment and landscaping to deter crime and aid police surveillance '' at a Michigan park . -- $ 450,000 for `` integrated urban data based in seven cities . '' No other details . -- $ 390,000 for a library and recreation center at Mackinac Island , Mich .
15647	The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars .
15648	So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about .
15650	The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important .
15651	But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work .
15652	The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs .
15653	We designed a comprehensive program , and we worked hard on it .
15657	What we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control .
15659	With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it .
15660	It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it .
15662	When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted , so that they create a market for themselves .
15665	If I am catching your attention , then read a bold and informative article in this September 's issue of Science by Ethan Nadelmann on this subject .
15666	We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs .
15668	Sometimes at a reception or cocktail party I advance these views and people head for somebody else .
15671	But I feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now , the next time around , when we have the next iteration of these programs , it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it .
15676	Imports of goods and services soared , while exports were flat .
15681	Many economists think the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade , because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper .
15683	A sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced .
15684	An inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a 2.9 % annual rate in the third quarter from 5 % in the second .
15690	He added : `` Inflation is lower than I think people expected it to be , and I think that 's good news . ''
15691	But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter .
15692	Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again .
15694	`` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive .
15696	While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP , it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs .
15702	Devastation from Hurricane Hugo , which slammed into the Southeast coast in late September , diminished personal income by about $ 4 billion , the department said , but it called the effect on the roughly $ 5 trillion economy `` negligible . ''
15703	Except for the loss from the hurricane , all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation .
15706	Northrop Corp. received a $ 93.5 million contract by the U.S. Air Force for production tooling and test equipment for the Tacit Rainbow defense-suppression missile .
15707	The contract provides additional equipment for Northrop , the prime contractor on the missile , and also supports a 1990 purchase of 90 missiles for follow-on flight tests .
15708	General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division said it is offering $ 750 cash incentives on all 1990 models of its full-size Blazer and Suburban truck lines .
15711	Proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem C$ 264 million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt , the company said .
15712	Canada 's largest department store operator said the rights offering will entitle holders of its ordinary shares , except residents in the U.S. and Britain , to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$ 31.25 a share .
15716	Hudson 's Bay said that Woodbridge Co. , which currently holds about 77 % of the ordinary shares , will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that are n't otherwise taken up .
15728	Unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily , these companies are suffering big drops in business as once-lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear .
15732	Others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created by budget-cutting .
15734	ERC International Inc. , which provides professional and technical services to the military , is refining its defense niche , not retreating from it .
15736	In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top Defense Department priority , ERC last year acquired W.J. Schafer Associates , a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative .
15737	While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded W.J. Schafer two contracts totaling $ 13.4 million , ERC 's chairman and founder , Jack Aalseth , says he bought the company `` more for its technology than its customer . ''
15739	As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled , three years of steady growth ended with a 69 % drop in income in this year 's first half .
15754	`` We 're trying to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry , '' says Vincent Salvatori , QuesTech 's chief executive .
15759	`` It was our first acquisition , '' he says , `` and it was a mistake . ''
15760	Some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best .
15761	Telos Corp. , a Santa Monica , Calif. , provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military , enjoyed steady growth until this year .
15763	A one-time write-off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame , but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the Army and delays in getting paid .
15764	Telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and `` bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities , '' says Lin Conger , Telos chairman and controlling shareholder .
15767	The company not only merged three military-electronics manufacturing operations , but also closed an unrelated plant that makes ordnance devices used in fighter planes and missiles .
15776	Nearly 20 years ago , Mr. Morishita , founder and chairman of Aichi Corp. , a finance company , received a 10-month suspended sentence from a Tokyo court for violating a money-lending law and an income tax law .
15777	He was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted , and attempting to evade income taxes by using a double accounting system .
15779	He was arrested , though not indicted , on at least three other occasions in the '60s and '70s : for assault and unlawful confinement , for fraud and forgery of private documents , and for extortion .
15780	Christies says it has had no contact with Mr. Morishita since the stock purchase , but that it 's happy to deal with him .
15783	Mr. Morishita is a leading figure among Japan 's 38,000 `` machikin , '' which lend to small companies , and `` sarakin , '' which lend to individuals .
15786	Aichi is a machikin , Mr. Utsunomiya says , and `` one of the nasty ones . ''
15787	In describing that business in general , he says that when the client ca n't repay the loan , some machikin `` clutch on like hyenas '' and even take over the client 's company .
15790	And the acquisition , which made Aska one of Christies ' top five shareholders , left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were .
15791	`` We 're an investor , '' Mr. Morishita says , sitting back in his purple gallery filled with some 20 Monets and Renoirs .
15796	In 30 years of collecting impressionist and Japanese paintings , he has acquired 600 items , he says , enough to persuade him to start a museum next year .
15799	`` He makes snap judgments , '' says Kiyotaka Kori , the art gallery 's manager and Mr. Morishita 's secretary for more than seven years .
15805	The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines to comment , and Mr. Kori , the tycoon 's secretary , says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income .
15807	Stretching his arms in his silky white shirt and squeaking his black shoes , he lectures a visitor about the way to sell American real estate and boasts about his friendship with Margaret Thatcher 's son .
15811	Not many people know the details of Mr. Morishita 's business , but it 's a source of rumors about shady dealings .
15816	From there , he set up his finance company and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real estate to building golf courses .
15818	He also owns courses in the U.S. and France .
15825	`` I quit after one try , whether I win or lose , '' he says .
15827	Mr. Morishita says he intends to expand his business to many other areas at home and abroad .
15831	Arthur Price resigned as president and chief executive officer of MTM Enterprises Inc. , a Studio-City , Calif. , entertainment concern .
15832	He co-founded the company with Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore in 1969 .
15837	But it said that its consumer banks in Oregon , California , Nevada and Washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by 14 % over the year-ago period .
15838	Private-sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter , but wage increases still are running above last year 's levels .
15839	The Labor Department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of 3.6 % in the first year and 3.0 % over the life of the contracts .
15840	The last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases , mostly in 1986 or 1987 , wages increased an average of 2.4 % a year over the life of the contracts .
15842	This reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities .
15843	Settlements reached in the first nine months of 1989 called for wage increases averaging 3.7 % in the first contract year and 3.1 % annually over the life of the contracts , the department said .
15844	For all of 1988 , union contracts provided for 2.5 % wage increases in the first year and 2.4 % over the life of the contracts .
15845	In the second quarter , contracts called for increases of 3.9 % in the first year and 3.4 % over the life of the contracts .
15846	The figures exclude lump-sum payments and cost-of-living adjustments , so the actual wage increases may have been bigger .
15848	Unions covered by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases .
15855	Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show .
15856	In the process , `` Batibot , '' an archaic Filipino word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language .
15857	`` It impresses on ordinary , young Filipinos that there 's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says Randy David , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show .
15860	The success of `` Batibot '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language .
15864	`` For the middle and upper-middle class -LCB- Filipino -RCB- is declasse , '' says Bien Lumbera , a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City 's University of the Philippines .

15889	There are only two large puppets in the program : Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing .

15897	In addition , CMS reported third-quarter net of $ 68.2 million , or 83 cents a share , up from $ 66.8 million , or 81 cents a share , a year ago .
15898	HEALTHDYNE Inc. , Atlanta , said its subsidiary , Home Nutritional Services Inc. , registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission an initial public offering of four million shares of common .
15900	The company estimates the offering price at between $ 14 and $ 16 a share .
15901	The company said it expects to use the proceeds to repay certain bank debt and for general corporate purposes , including establishing new operating centers and possible acquisitions .
15905	Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year .
15907	Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion .
15908	The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load .
15911	Earlier this year , Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors .
15915	Bostic is one of the previously unnamed units , and the first of the five to be sold .
15916	The company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year .
15919	`` Our divestiture program is on schedule , and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ 1 billion in net proceeds , '' said Nolan D. Archibald , Black & Decker 's president and chief executive officer , in a statement .
15926	Embedded in the `` budget '' being concocted by the House-Senate conference committee is something that looks , smells and waddles like a duck .
15930	The Hart-Scott filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met .
15931	Typically , Hart-Scott is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic .
15932	The $ 20,000 tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal , but a serious drag on thousands of small , friendly deals .
15933	One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission .
15938	Michael Grobstein , 46 years old , was named vice chairman for planning , marketing and industry services , a new post .
15939	Mr. Grobstein had been a vice chairman of Ernst & Whinney , an accounting firm that merged with rival Arthur Young in July to form Ernst & Young , a major accounting , tax and management consulting firm .
15942	At a news conference , Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice .
15943	The chairman said his board members , including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital .
15944	Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business .
15945	But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte , which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday .
15946	At the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas 's bid .
15947	For the moment , the sources said , he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for Paribas .
15948	Mr. Fournier said Navigation Mixte 's 1989 unconsolidated , or parent-company , profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs -LRB- $ 754.4 million -RRB- , up from 633.8 million francs last year .
15952	Analysts noted that over the past 20 years , Mr. Fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts .
15956	Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse , a government regulatory agency , but analysts said that is considered likely .
15957	Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas 's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987 , and said it now holds just under 5 % of Paribas 's shares .
15958	Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 % .
15959	The petition is still pending , but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas .
15961	Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital all strongly support him , but some analysts said they are n't so sure .
15966	Paribas says it will offer 1,850 francs -LRB- $ 296.95 -RRB- each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights , and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1 , which will receive only partial dividends this year .
15970	The gross proceeds from the sale of the notes , which will be due on Nov. 1 , 2004 , will be used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes , the company said .
15978	The 1986 Tax Reform Act has nearly eliminated the number of large , profitable corporations that do n't pay federal income tax , according to Citizens for Tax Justice , a nonprofit , labor-funded research and lobbying group .
15979	In a study of 250 of the nation 's richest companies , the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with 40 in 1986 , the last year the old tax rules were in effect , and 16 in 1987 , when some of the new tax provisions went into effect .
15981	The report , released yesterday , comes as Congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping tax-revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes .
15982	In the corporate realm , the 1986 law abolished the investment-tax credit , scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax , a levy to ensure all money-making businesses pay some federal tax .
15983	The combination of lower rates and fewer loopholes has meant that the so-called average effective tax rate -- the rate actually paid -- of the 250 corporations surveyed reached 26.5 % in 1988 , compared with 14.3 % in the years from 1981 through 1985 , according to the study .
15988	Still , Kroger Co. , Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , CSX Corp. , Illinois Power Co. , Media General Inc. , Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and Gulf States Utilities Co. , did n't pay any federal income tax last year although they garnered a total of $ 1.2 billion in profits , the group said .
15990	The lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments .
15998	He retains his titles of president and chief operating officer and succeeds as chief executive Howard O. Painter Jr. , who remains chairman of the board .

16000	In search of buyers for upscale department-store chains such as Bloomingdale 's and Saks Fifth Avenue , investment bankers are turning to -- who else ? The Japanese .
16004	Japanese retail executives say the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the U.S. is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles .
16005	The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the U.S. market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home wo n't translate into success in the U.S. .
16010	Britain 's B.A.T Industries PLC is trying to unwind its U.S. retailing operations , which include such well-known stores as Saks Fifth Avenue , Marshall Field 's , Breuners and Ivey 's .
16016	Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in Bloomingdale 's , which bankers in Tokyo estimate could cost between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion .
16017	Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing Bloomingdale 's chairman , Marvin Traub , and more than half are seeking additional information on the group , bankers say .
16020	Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including Bloomingdale 's .
16021	Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out .
16022	Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network .
16023	`` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work , '' says one investment banker who follows the retail industry .

16045	It said the regular 1988 deficit amounted to $ 43.5 million , based on revenue of $ 74.4 million and expenses of $ 117.9 million .
16046	But it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $ 57.2 million .
16049	Council member Cardinal Gerald Carter of Toronto told Vatican Radio : `` Now that we say we covered our deficit this year , people are going to relax and say well that 's fine , the Holy See is out of the hole .
16053	There will be no sightseeing , no shopping and no social events . ''

16063	British postal authorities say they have uncovered a large-scale scheme where unscrupulous stamp dealers chemically removed stamp cancellations , regummed the stamps and sold them to U.S. collectors or , in large lots , to British businesses .
16066	The charities regularly sell used stamps , which they collect from children and other donors , to raise funds .
16068	The company 's U.S. subsidiary , Matsushita Electric Corp. of America , had donated over $ 35,000 worth of Matsushita-made flashlights and batteries to residents shortly after the disaster , a company spokesman said .
16069	Several other Japanese companies and regional governments have sent aid to San Francisco .
16070	Sumitomo Bank donated $ 500,000 , Tokyo prefecture $ 15,000 and the city of Osaka $ 10,000 .
16082	Di Giorgio Corp. said it 's continuing talks with potential buyers of certain units , but has reached no agreement on any deals .

16086	Some lousy earnings reports whacked the stock market , but bond prices fell only slightly and the dollar rose a little against most major currencies .
16089	The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen , but soared against the pound following the resignation of Britain 's chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson .
16090	Analysts have complained that third-quarter corporate earnings have n't been very good , but the effect hit home particularly hard yesterday .
16091	Compaq Computer nose-dived $ 8.625 a share , to $ 100 , and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday .
16093	The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading .
16110	In late New York trading the dollar was at 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen compared with 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen Wednesday .
16113	The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $ 17.2 billion to the departments of State , Justice , and Commerce in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government .
16114	An estimated $ 40 million would come annually from a new $ 20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the Justice Department , and Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees would rise by 25 % to fund a $ 26 million increase in the agency 's budget .
16115	Yesterday 's vote on Japanese-American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision , which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988 .
16119	No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met .
16120	The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority .
16121	As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders .
16122	The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp .
16123	The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
16125	And on back-to-back roll calls , 206-199 and 223-178 , the Appropriations Committee leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H. -RRB-
16126	The estimated $ 40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided between the Justice Department 's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission , which both face serious cuts if the income is n't realized .
16127	The Federal Bureau of Investigation is slated to receive $ 30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil cases , and the judiciary will rely on another $ 32 million from bankruptcy charges , including a 33 % increase in the current filing fee .
16128	The $ 17.2 billion total for the bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.2 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds approved by the House-Senate conference yesterday , and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance .
16129	The House agreed to defer for a year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants but , by a 287-123 margin , the chamber stripped a Senate initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states , such as New Hampshire and Delaware , to $ 1.6 million from $ 500,000 .
16132	The measure includes $ 2 million secured by Mr. Rudman for a marine-research project at the University of New Hampshire , and Sen. Ernest Hollings -LRB- D. , S.C . -RRB- used his power to add $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the Commerce Department .
16134	The Big Three U.S. auto makers posted losses in their core North American automotive businesses for the third quarter , and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period .
16138	Still , the combined profit of Ford , Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. fell 44 % to $ 1.02 billion from $ 1.83 billion a year earlier , excluding a one-time gain of $ 309 million at Chrysler from the sale of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. stock .
16141	GM 's common closed at $ 44.375 a share , down 50 cents , Ford fell 37.5 cents to end at $ 47.50 , and Chrysler eased 37.5 cents to $ 22.25 , all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
16143	As Japanese auto makers gained market share , the Big Three , with GM in the lead , slashed North American production and launched a retail discounting blitz .
16147	But the costly efforts did little to slow Japanese market gains , and domestic car sales have plunged 19 % since the Big Three ended many of their programs Sept. 30 .
16148	GM , Ford and Chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter U.S. output plans an estimated 15 % from 1988 levels .
16149	If sales do n't pick up , the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again .
16151	The No. 2 auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker U.S. market -- for a 44 % drop in net to $ 477.1 million , or $ 1.03 a share , on revenue of $ 20.24 billion .
16153	The Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the U.S. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter .
16154	Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services .
16155	A year earlier , Ford reported record net of $ 856.3 million , or $ 1.78 a share , on revenue of $ 20.38 billion .
16156	In the latest nine months , Ford earned $ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51 a share , compared with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53 a share .
16158	But David N. McCammon , vice president , finance , insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results `` better in this downturn than in prior downturns , '' when Ford had net losses .
16159	Still , Mr. McCammon said Ford expects the U.S. economy to weaken through the end of 1990 , causing weaker sales and production .
16162	In the 1988 fourth quarter , Ford had net of $ 1.16 billion , or $ 2.42 a share .
16163	Chrysler 's operating profit fell to a scant $ 22 million , or 10 cents a share , its lowest quarterly total in seven years .
16164	Its $ 309 million , or $ 1.32 a share , gain from the sale of 75 million Mitsubishi shares made net $ 331 million , or $ 1.42 a share .
16167	A year earlier , Chrysler 's net was $ 113 million , or 50 cents a share .
16168	Mr. Miller said costs of incentives caused a `` moderate '' loss in the Highland Park , Mich. , company 's North American car and truck business .
16169	He said the loss was n't `` that much different '' from Ford 's $ 37 million loss on U.S. automotive operations , but he declined to be specific .
16171	He said Chrysler `` is no longer sure '' of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year .
16173	In the nine months , net was $ 1.02 billion , or $ 4.38 a share , including the gain from the Mitsubishi stock sale , compared with $ 617 million , or $ 2.77 a share , after a charge of $ 93 million , or 42 cents a share , for plant closings in the 1988 period .
16178	An 8.5 % drop in North American factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue , and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on 1990 model vehicles delivered during the period , a GM spokesman said .
16180	In one breakdown , GM attributed half of its net to its two big technology units , Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp .
16189	`` Measure for Measure '' is one of Shakespeare 's `` problem '' plays , so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy , comedy or history .
16190	Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now .
16191	Last season , Hartford Stage director Mark Lamos mounted a production at Lincoln Center , and currently two other productions -- one just closed at the Old Globe in San Diego and another now at the Seattle Rep -- overlap with Mr. Boyd 's .
16192	In the play , the Duke of Vienna despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical Angelo , hoping he can set things right .
16194	When , however , Claudio 's sister , Isabella , a novitiate in a convent , goes to Angelo to plead her brother 's case , the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and , in a supreme act of hypocrisy , demands that Isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life .
16195	Meanwhile , the Duke , who set the original scheme in motion , appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the Duke arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned .
16196	For the Alley production , scene designer Peter David Gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience .
16199	When Isabella -LRB- Ellen Lauren -RRB- confronts her brother Claudio -LRB- Matt Loney -RRB- in his cell , explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom ; when Isabella and the disguised Duke -LRB- Philip Kerr -RRB- conspire to trick Angelo ; and when Mariana -LRB- Annalee Jefferies -RRB- , a woman wronged by Angelo , confronts him with his past misdeeds , the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence .
16201	When , however , he decides to be modern , or more accurately , when he decides to be trendy , the results are far less satisfactory .
16202	Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences .
16203	It 's a valid approach , but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste .
16204	In his `` Measure , '' Mr. Boyd has `` modernized '' the pimps and prostitutes of Vienna whom Angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites , punk rockers and heavy metal types , with a strong emphasis on leather , chains and porno-inspired costumes .
16206	When Claudio is arrested , he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles .
16207	When the opportunist Lucio -LRB- Jack Stehlin -RRB- visits the convent to inform Isabella of her brother 's fate , Lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear , but brings along a voluptuous companion -LRB- Jill Powell -RRB- , not in Shakespeare 's script , to undulate lasciviously .
16208	Meanwhile , the pimp Pompey -LRB- Glen Allen Pruett -RRB- , dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece , indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe .
16209	The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination .
16210	The inclusion at one point , for example , of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors , ranging from Jim Bakker and Leona Helmsley to Zsa Zsa Gabor , is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. Boyd 's ability .
16215	Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler , head of Theatre Communications Group , to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board .
16216	None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. Brown 's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative .
16217	Now the Alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts .
16218	Not only is Mr. Boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage , the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years .
16219	As opposed to the $ 1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season , the 1988-89 year concluded with a $ 200,000 surplus and a $ 500,000 cash reserve .
16220	Admittedly last season 's runaway hit , `` Steel Magnolias , '' helped a lot , but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board .
16223	Democratic leaders have bottled up President Bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the Senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely .
16225	And neither Democrats nor Republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes .
16226	`` The 60-vote requirement will be there and they do n't have the 60 votes , '' Sen. Mitchell said .
16231	Sen. Packwood has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill , now pending in the Senate , that would authorize aid to Poland and Hungary .
16232	Democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster , or extended debate .
16247	It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
16250	The transaction , for cash and stock , would represent the biggest European takeover since 1980 for New York-based Marsh & McLennan , the world 's largest insurance broker .
16254	Analysts speculated that Marsh & McLennan would spend between 250 million marks -LRB- $ 136.4 million -RRB- and 350 million marks for the rest of Gradmann & Holler , or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm 's estimated earnings .
16260	Mr. Kiep said he sought the combination because `` all our large clients in Germany are becoming European companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker '' to serve them as well in Paris as in Germany .
16263	United Technologies Corp. won an $ 18 million Army contract for helicopter modifications and spare parts .
16266	Furukawa Electric Co. said it plans to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan .
16271	Furukawa said the U.S. market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality .
16274	Compaq Computer Corp. said that its net income rose 51 % in the third quarter , bolstered by unusual gains from its investment in a disk-drive maker and reflecting continued growth in its European operations .
16275	The computer maker said net jumped to $ 87 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 58 million , or $ 1.40 a share , a year earlier .
16277	The latest quarter 's results , however , included a pretax gain of $ 13.7 million , or 20 cents a share , in the carrying value of the company 's investment in Conner Peripherals Inc. and a $ 7.6 million gain , or 11 cents a share , from the sale of one million Conner shares .
16278	Net for the nine months was $ 254 million , or $ 5.94 a share , up 56 % from $ 163 million , or $ 4.06 a share , a year earlier .
16280	Net for the year-earlier nine months also included a gain of $ 9.7 million , or 15 cents a share , in the carrying value of the Conner investment .
16282	`` Over the next couple of years we would not be surprised to see Europe and international -LCB- sales -RCB- represent 50 % of the company 's revenues , '' he said .
16283	During the third quarter , Compaq purchased a former Wang Laboratories manufacturing facility in Stirling , Scotland , which will be used for international service and repair operations .
16286	Wilson H. Taylor , president and chief executive officer of this insurance and financial services concern , was elected to the additional post of chairman .
16289	Diversified Investment Group Inc. said it agreed to be acquired by Star States Corp. for stock valued at $ 13.75 a share , or about $ 24.4 million .
16292	The agreement is subject to regulatory approval and resolution of lawsuits brought by certain Diversified holders in connection with the proposed merger .
16293	Chandler Insurance Co. said it expects to report third-quarter net income jumped 97 % to $ 2.8 million , or 51 cents a share .
16294	In the year-earlier quarter , the automobile and trucking insurer had earnings of $ 1.4 million , or 48 cents a share on a restated basis , on revenue of $ 16.5 million .
16295	In an interview , W. Brent LeGere , chairman and chief executive officer , said he expects revenue in the latest quarter to total about $ 28 million .
16297	Mr. LeGere attributed the earnings increase to growth in the company 's longhaul trucking insurance lines and the ability to keep premium rates firm .
16299	The maker of water-treatment chemicals and equipment said it will select the plant site early next year , and production is expected to begin in 1991 .

16304	Michael Deaver , the former White House aide , has become the most recent addition to the teeming ranks of fallen politicians and officials earning their way as lobbyists and consultants here .
16307	Let the president demand strict new ethics rules : With four sitting House members accused of sexual misdeeds , amid the unfolding HUD scandal and after the Wright debacle , `` people are slightly dulled by scandal , '' says political humorist Art Buchwald .
16316	As if he were still in his old job , Mr. Wright , by resigning with his title instead of being forced from his job , by law enjoys a $ 120,000 annual office expense allowance , three paid staffers , up to $ 67,000 for stationery and telephones and continued use of the franking privilege .
16321	On the edge of fashionable Georgetown , in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom he wo n't name , Mr. Deaver is trying to reclaim his reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town .
16322	There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan .
16323	The former $ 3 million-a-year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time counseling other recovering alcoholics .
16326	He is also a recovering workaholic , relaxing with his family and creating topiary , or garden-shrub sculpture , a fashionable pursuit for which he developed a passion during his three-year legal ordeal .
16330	`` When someone says , ` I 've turned to God , ' everybody lays off , '' observes Frank Mankiewicz , an old Washington hand and former aide to Robert Kennedy .
16331	Thus have Charles Colson and Jeb Magruder launched successful post-Watergate careers at the pulpit .
16334	He is now in solo law practice in Washington , but his fees have been meager and he failed in efforts to win a chunk of his ex-wife 's royalties on her tell-all book .
16335	From time to time he returns to the monastery for prayer , meditation and pro bono legal work .

16365	Rita Jenrette , the former wife of Abscam-indicted Rep. John Jenrette , has yet to hit it big in Hollywood , although with roles in such movies as `` Zombie Island Massacre '' and `` Aunt Ida 's Bikini Shop , '' she is doing a lot better than her former husband .
16369	Richard Secord , the retired Air Force general felled in the Iran-Contra scandal , is all but ruined -- forced to sell his Virginia home and pull his kids out of college , according to a recent fund-raising appeal sent out on his behalf .
16370	Yet his co-defendant in the case -- also a former military officer by the name of Oliver North -- has been busily and profitably burnishing his involvement in the affair .
16377	Sex scandals make people look careless and silly , and one of the worst sins in Washington is to be laughed at .
16378	`` You can be wicked , but not foolish , '' says Mr. Mankiewicz .

16402	The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba , the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua 's Contra guerrillas .
16407	`` Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. Mulroney said recently .
16409	`` Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire '' between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS , said Jeffrey Simpson , a columnist in Toronto 's Globe & Mail newspaper .
16412	France voted the same as the U.S. 76 % of the time , West Germany 79 % and Britain 83 % .

16416	Cuba has been suspended from OAS membership , but the organization 's members are discussing Cuba 's reinstatement .
16417	Robert H. Knight 's Oct. 5 editorial-page article bemoaning violence in comedy movies -LRB- `` Hollywood , You Slay Me '' -RRB- is interesting , but somewhat off-base .
16418	As a fan of older movies from the 1920s on , I do not find modern comedies contain violence , sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies .
16420	For example , one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy `` Kind Hearts and Coronets , '' in which the entire comedy is based on actor Dennis Price 's murdering eight titled relatives -LRB- all played by Alec Guinness -RRB- because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title .
16421	Similarly , one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the `` murder mystery\/comedy . ''
16422	The `` Thin Man '' series of movies , as well as many others , based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives ' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered .
16426	Keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is flattened by a steamroller only to pop right back up and peer in the window of a Boeing 747 -- from the outside -- as it takes off .
16428	Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama , or anything else , without foul-mouthed cursing .
16429	Sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script , and high-tech special effects are continually substituted for good plot and character development .
16430	In short , we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a PG-13 or R rating .
16431	Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex , violence and gutter language are included as a crutch .
16432	However , these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies , and I believe Mr. Knight errs when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making .
16438	The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1 % rate of the two previous months , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- said .
16442	The Clarksburg , W.Va. , producer of gas and oil , said it wants shareholders to approve the split because it would `` enhance the marketability '' and trading of the stock .
16443	If approved at a shareholder meeting in December , the number of shares outstanding would decrease to five million from 50 million , and par value would rise to 10 cents from a penny .
16445	Terms were n't disclosed , but Duriron said the deal will be completed through an exchange of stock .
16447	Duriron , a maker of pumps , valves and other controls , said the acquisition wo n't impact its 1989 profit .
16450	Most of the August decrease was attributed to lower order backlogs in the primary metal and electric and electronics-product industries .
16454	The remaining 51 % of the joint venture will be controlled by Polish lubricants manufacturers , refiners and technical institutes .
16455	Explonaft will develop application guidelines for lubricants , sell high-quality mineral oils , and offer services in industrial cleaning and related fields .
16456	Burmah , which has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal-working fluids in Poland , described the joint venture as `` fairly small . ''
16458	Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19 % from a year ago on the strength of the company 's operations in various chemicals and fibers , and in petroleum .
16460	Du Pont , unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics , is benefiting from its broad range of businesses .
16461	The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market , for which the company is a supplier , and a strengthening in the dollar , which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars .
16462	The Wilmington , Del. , company reported net of $ 547 million , or $ 2.36 a share , which was in line with Wall Street estimates .
16463	In the year-earlier period , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a share .
16466	`` We have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to , '' said Edgar Woolard Jr. , Du Pont 's chairman and chief executive officer , in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April .
16468	A spokesman for Seagram , the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family , said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ 33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends .
16473	The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide , a white pigment used in paints , paper and plastics .
16476	Profit climbed to $ 98 million from $ 71 million in the petroleum segment , as Du Pont 's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume .
16482	And profit from polymers dropped to $ 107 million from $ 122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets .
16483	For the nine months , Du Pont earned $ 2 billion , or $ 8.46 a share , up 18 % from $ 1.69 billion , or $ 7.03 a share , a year earlier .
16495	Western European leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal : the dizzying political changes under way in Eastern Europe .
16496	French President Francois Mitterrand , European Community Commission President Jacques Delors , Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the West .
16497	They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the East is to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity .
16498	This would make the market-oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries , they argue , and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from West to East .
16499	`` The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East , '' Mr. Mitterrand told the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday , `` is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community . ''
16500	Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank , and that the treaty be ratified by 1992 .
16502	One basis for linking change in the East and change in the West is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans , despite the U.S. 's obvious strategic and economic interest .
16503	Says a European strategist : `` The U.S. tends to look at Eastern Europe -LCB- not including the Soviet Union -RCB- as Europe looks at Latin America : important but far away .
16505	A reintegrated Europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies .
16506	There is likely to be a natural division of labor , says Francois Heisbourg , director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union , and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East .
16507	The designation at July 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step .
16510	Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some Western European leaders , especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , remain skeptical about European political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds .
16513	`` For Poland and Hungary we need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers . ''
16514	He notes that the Marshall Plan of U.S. aid to Europe `` did n't just throw money at post-war Europe , it also liberalized and opened up those markets . ''
16518	He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. Gorbachev scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy , `` Our interest lies in a controlled transformation , a contained nuclear reaction , so we need to help him , and not just with words . ''
16519	Managing change , he adds , will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the EC , especially in dealing with the question of German reunification .
16521	Any push for a Gorbachev vision of a `` common European home , '' implying the eventual dissolution of the EC , a Soviet-German partnership and the withdrawal of U.S. forces , `` would be a very , very serious problem , '' he says .
16522	He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate Europe , but warns of `` a risk of profound change in the heart of the European Community from a Germany that is too strong , even if democratic . ''
16523	He adds : `` We , and the rest of the EC have to talk to the Germans , now , frankly and raise these future risks with them . ''
16524	While many commentators , particularly French ones , worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized Europe or the speeded-up withdrawal of American troops , Mr. Roper in London sees a more positive scenario .
16526	`` They want reassurance we wo n't try to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact ... .
16527	In return , the U.K. and France could keep their nuclear weapons .
16528	He adds : `` Once both sides feel comfortable , it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the East .
16529	Kyle Technology Corp. said a Seattle investor has signed a letter of intent to buy the company for about $ 3.1 million , or $ 1.20 a share .
16531	The transaction has been approved by Kyle 's board , but requires the approval of the company 's shareholders .
16536	Once triggered , the rights allow holders to buy additional shares at 50 % of the then current market price or , at the board 's discretion , to receive securities or assets .
16537	Separately , Dominion Textile posted net income of 4.7 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 4 million -RRB- , or 12 Canadian cents a share , for the fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30 .
16538	The company had a net loss of C$ 2.3 million , or 14 Canadian cents a share , a year ago .
16547	Ohbayashi officials said the purchase was undertaken to participate in ventures in and around New York City .
16554	H. Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp. , a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $ 17 billion .
16557	U.S. Trust , a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S. , has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established , and heavily promoted , private-banking businesses of their own .
16565	`` We have always taken smaller accounts , but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow , '' Mr. Schwarz says .
16566	`` Our bread and butter is still the $ 2 million to $ 20 million account , '' he says .
16569	In this year 's third quarter , for example , net was $ 10.5 million , or $ 1.05 a share , compared with $ 10.3 million , or $ 1.02 a share , a year earlier .
16573	Mr. Schwarz 's great-grandfather founded the New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz , but his family no longer has ties to the company .
16576	It will include Messrs. Schwarz and Maurer .
16577	Donald M. Roberts , 54 , treasurer , and Frederick S. Wonham , 58 , who takes responsibility for the funds-service group , were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman .
16578	Mr. Roberts continues as treasurer , and Mr. Wonham remains responsible for the offices of comptroller , planning , marketing and general services .
16579	Frederick B. Taylor , 48 , also was named a vice chairman and chief investment officer , a new post .
16581	Mr. Taylor also was named a director , increasing the board to 22 , but is not part of the new office of the chairman .
16583	Sun Microsystems Inc. , snapping back to profitability after its first quarterly loss as a public firm , said it earned $ 5.2 million , or seven cents a share , in the fiscal first quarter .
16585	In the 1988 period , the company earned $ 20.6 million , or 26 cents a share .
16591	But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer .
16593	Mr. McNealy said the issues that hurt Sun 's performance earlier this year are now `` largely '' behind the firm , and he indicated that Sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year .
16595	While this indicates continued strong demand for the company 's desk-top computers , Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co .
16596	Recently , analysts have said Sun also is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp. , which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year , and Next Inc .
16598	Mr. Rogers , 60 years old , succeeds J.V. White , 64 , who will remain chairman and chairman of the executive committee .
16599	Mr. Rogers , who was president and chief operating officer of Equifax , will retain his position as president .
16601	A merchant bank and investment fund have agreed to co-sponsor a reorganization plan to bring Sharon Steel Corp. out of Chapter 11 proceedings and to acquire the company 's steel-related assets in a transaction valued at more than $ 300 million .
16602	Castle Harlan Inc. , a New York merchant bank , and Quantum Fund said they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of Sharon 's liabilities .
16603	The balance of the company 's assets and liabilities would be transferred to a new company that would be owned by Sharon 's creditors .
16605	Castle Harlan and Quantum said the plan is expected to be filed within 60 days with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh .
16607	Castle Harlan said that such financing is already being sought and that a formal proposal would be made to Sharon 's Chapter 11 trustee and other Sharon creditors over the next few days .
16610	Mr. Posner resigned as president and chief executive officer of Sharon in April 1988 .
16611	He remains chairman , but wields little power at the company .
16614	The Castle Harlan group includes Walter Sieckman , former chief operating officer of Sharon , and Wolfgang Jansen , former executive vice president .
16617	Two old friends , George Bush and Deng Xiaoping , are trying to limit further damage to U.S.-China ties .
16620	In a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation , Mr. Deng sent an indirect signal to Washington via T.D. Lee , a Columbia University physicist who met Mr. Deng and other Chinese leaders in Beijing last month .
16623	The Chinese leader , Mr. Lee informed Mr. Bush , expressed some regret for what had happened in Beijing and conceded that China 's officials bore some responsibility .
16624	Mr. Lee says Mr. Deng told him : `` We should not mind those who participated in demonstrations , signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes . ''
16626	We must not shirk our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators . ''
16629	And he told the physicist that China 's leaders were `` very much concerned '' about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families .
16632	He says that the Chinese never asked him to convey their statements to President Bush , but that the White House spontaneously invited him to do so .
16633	Mr. Lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in China , but attributes that to the fact that the situation in China is `` very complex . ''
16638	Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations .
16642	So far , the victims are officially considered evil-doers , and their families receive no compensation .
16646	`` In the U.S. , there are still people who want to crush China and interfere in our internal affairs , '' Zhu Qizhen , China 's new ambassador to the U.S. , said as he left for Washington last week .
16647	The House and Senate are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation .
16650	But as legislative action , they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to rescind .
16651	Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges , a suspension of most high-level government contacts and a halt to U.S. trade enhancement programs , such as the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade Development Program .
16654	`` Bush and Deng are hoping -LCB- that -RCB- cooler heads prevail .
16655	The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug , EPO .
16656	EPO , or erythropoietin , is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells .
16665	The volume of red cells donated by the EPO-treated patients was 41 % higher per donor , the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported .
16667	TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving .
16670	Labor and business leaders , quoted at the White House Rose Garden rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .
16674	That year a four-man group headed by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service , was assigned the task of designing a plan .
16676	This team initially called its new model Personal Retirement Account , or `` PRA . ''
16681	One in 1981 raised to $ 2,000 a year from $ 1,500 the amount a person could put , tax-deductible , into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans .
16682	This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers , banks , mutual funds and others .
16683	But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth .
16684	IRA account assets have grown to about $ 400 billion from $ 393 billion last year and just $ 26 billion in 1981 .
16688	But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar .
16690	But it did n't elaborate , and it remains unclear how far Western tourists and foreigners living in Moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut .
16695	They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up .
16698	With more than 300 billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on , Soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway .
16699	Moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble is n't worth much , announcing in August that it will pay Soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas .
16701	The State Bank 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away .
16702	Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks , but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise .
16705	Soviet companies needing Western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids .
16706	Plans for the auction , which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event , have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency .
16707	Soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it , and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate .
16709	If foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new , better exchange rate , that would enable the State Bank to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time .
16713	But under current rules , they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip .
16719	Kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with Maynard , Mass.-based Digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs .
16723	That 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations .
16725	He said that American Telephone & Telegraph , MCI Communications Corp. , Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital 's subcontractors on the project .
16726	`` When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services , we wanted to get the best vendor for that service , '' said Paul Allen , the spokesman .
16727	`` That 's why we went with IBM for data center management ... and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications .
16728	This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System , and some members of Congress think it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank .
16731	In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond , Va. , a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank , but times have changed .
16734	In the beginning , the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board .
16735	But in 1935 , when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression , it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board .
16737	He said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and , somehow , he did n't think that was a good thing .
16740	There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress , as in 1935 , would be doing something .
16742	Nicholas Brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much .
16744	That may have pleased the secretary , but H. Erich Heinemann , chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. , suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs .
16747	After the October 1987 market crash , Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it .
16749	This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power , but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job .
16750	The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well .
16751	Mr. Brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions , but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago .
16757	Allan Meltzer , a Carnegie-Mellon University economist , noted that the Fed 's record included the longest , most sustained , peacetime inflation in our history , dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989 .
16758	The inflation-growth argument is an old one , but Mr. Brady , on the board or off , is surely trying to influence Fed policy .
16759	Equally importantly , the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the U.S. dollar down by shopping avidly for West German marks and Japanese yen .
16760	The treasury can do something on its own , but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed .
16762	The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets , all right , but through August , at least , it appeared to be `` sterilizing '' the intervention .
16763	In other words , it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market .
16766	But it 's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values .
16767	After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing , but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar .
16769	The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know .
16771	Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . ''
16773	This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow .
16775	The latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression .
16777	Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal .
16778	Those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake .
16779	Earlier this week , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk .
16780	Hungary is no longer a `` Socialist Peoples '' republic , the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R. 's Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany 's new maximum leader .
16781	All of that is just for starters , or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding .
16782	Of like , though lesser , note , Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost , and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev , in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so .
16783	And , last but not least , President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as `` absolutely extraordinary '' and believes that Mr. Krenz `` ca n't turn the clock back '' in East Germany because the change is too inexorable , '' as he told the New York Times 's R.W. Apple Jr .
16784	-LRB- In other words , after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences , the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from Berlin to Siberia is a good thing to be welcomed , rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion . -RRB-
16786	For journalists , however , who write what they fondly view as history 's first draft , this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy 's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder .
16788	The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million .
16789	All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . ''
16790	Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target .
16792	He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ?
16793	Primarily because there 's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan 's personal values , or lack of them .
16795	The theme song for the 1980s has been , `` Anything Goes , '' and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism .
16796	There are those who say that this is nothing new , that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced .
16803	And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't '' and brazen it out .
16804	As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong .
16806	Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze 's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair .
16807	The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government `` violated norms of behavior '' in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station .
16808	We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra , and that apparently is n't going to change .
16813	Thus , no standards , no judgment and no values .
16815	No , we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him , enlisting it in the service of private gain , just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth , play disingenuous games about their activities or , to steal a phrase , make public service a private trough .
16817	He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in Eastern Europe , and it is a defensible position .
16819	We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah .
16822	Cineplex Odeon Corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive , Garth Drabinsky , is considering bidding 780.6 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 666 million -RRB- to acquire the company .
16823	The board said Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating financing before offering C$ 16.40 a share to acquire all of Cineplex 's shares outstanding .
16824	The directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders .
16825	The directors said if Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22 , it will reimburse them a maximum of C$ 8.5 million for expenses related to a bid .
16826	`` We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid , '' said Sandra Kolber , spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and Cineplex 's major shareholder , MCA Inc .
16827	MCA and Cineplex 's other major shareholder , Montreal-based financier Charles Bronfman and his associates , have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by Mr. Drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder .
16828	MCA holds half of Cineplex 's equity and 33 % of its voting rights through restricted voting shares , while Bronfman interests hold about 24 % of the company 's equity .
16830	She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky 's offer `` is all cash , and it 's for all of the company . ''
16831	Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company .
16832	`` All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out , '' said Jeffery Logsdon , an analyst with Crowell , Weedon in Los Angeles .
16833	`` If a bid materializes at that price , shareholders will have every reason to be glad , but the question of financing still remains . ''
16834	Last April , Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2 % of Cineplex for C$ 17.50 a share from Bronfman associates .
16837	The directors did n't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky 's new proposal , but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ 57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City , Calif. , if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer .
16838	`` This is being done at the suggestion of -LCB- Mr. Drabinsky -RCB- and to accommodate him , to facilitate his financing arrangements , '' Ms. Kolber said .
16839	In addition , the directors said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful , Cineplex expects Rank Organisation PLC to acquire the 51 % of Cineplex 's Film House unit it does n't own , and provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing .
16840	Michael Gifford , Rank 's chief executive , said the British theater chain 's total involvement `` would n't exceed $ 100 million '' but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed Film House purchase .
16844	`` Where 's the bid ? '' asked Pierre Panet-Raymond , an analyst and broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd .
16845	Mr. Panet-Raymond said he does n't think Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb are `` anywhere close '' to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again .
16847	Two West German chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry 's standing among environmental groups and the general public .
16852	This year , Hoechst will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in Frankfurt , Spain and Brazil .
16854	Also , BASF AG , another large chemicals company , said it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics .
16856	Mr. Manzanec , who succeeds retiring Richard C. Dixon , will be responsible for gas supply , regulatory affairs , and marketing and transportation and exchange for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. , Trunkline Gas Co. , Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Algonquin Gas Transmission Co .
16859	The move , which was expected , marks the first time since Prohibition that Coors has sold a non-alcoholic beverage , and marks the company 's entry into a crowded , but fast-growing market that generated about $ 2.2 billion in sales last year .
16861	Perrier , sold by Perrier Group of America , a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of Paris , and Evian , sold by a U.S. unit BSN of France , are distributed to urban areas nationally , but are less available in rural communities .
16863	The company said the water will be called Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in Coors beer .
16864	The company said it will sell the water plain and with lemon-lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28-ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six-packs .
16865	The test markets , though not specified , will be in northern California , Arizona and Colorado , some of the hottest bottled-water markets .
16866	Some of America 's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs-down to a U.S. proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies .
16867	In Geneva , where world trade talks are being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT , the European Community called the U.S. proposal `` a step backward . ''
16868	And Japan 's minister of agriculture , forestry and fisheries told a committee of Japan 's parliament that Washington 's proposal was impractical and that Tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers .
16869	The U.S. , in a far-reaching plan submitted to the Geneva meeting Tuesday , proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years .
16870	U.S. officials said the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies .
16873	EC officials say they are irked that the U.S. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the `` elimination '' of export subsides , not just reduction .
16874	EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said the U.S. plan `` calls into question '' the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking `` substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection . ''
16880	The U.S. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free-trade goals would be achieved .
16884	It would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .
16885	Seeking to allay European concerns , U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the new U.S. plan would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . ''
16890	Control Data 's third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp .
16891	The unit has 6,000 customers and , according to one analyst , had 1988 revenue of about $ 85 million .
16892	Under the agreement , which had been widely expected , Bell Atlantic would be buying Control Data 's customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities .
16896	Lawrence Perlman , Control Data 's president and chief operating officer , said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's `` strategy to be a data solutions company . ''
16897	Thomas Vassiliades , president of Bell Atlantic 's customer services division , said the acquisition would give the company 's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in `` the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies .
16898	Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography .
16899	These decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars , and from journalists as well .
16903	The publisher argued in response that the `` fair use '' statute permits quotation `` for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , ... scholarship , or research . ''
16906	Verbatim quotation , the judge believed , was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity , bigotry , paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard 's own words .
16912	Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller 's quotations from Mr. Hubbard 's unpublished writings , because they were not necessary to prove historical points , failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright .
16915	In a decision in April of this year , Judge Roger Miner , joined by Judge Frank Altimari , agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval 's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright .
16922	Decisions by the Second Circuit itself , Judge Oakes continued , had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use .
16923	And the injunction Judges Miner and Altimari would so readily have granted had New Era sued in time ?
16924	Suppression of the book , Judge Oakes observed , would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment .
16925	Moreover , and here Judge Oakes went to the heart of the question , `` Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources , letters , diaries , and memoranda .
16928	And of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers , whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries .
16929	But in the `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act .
16931	Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship .
16932	Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear to have a clue .
16934	As matters stand , the Salinger ruling , torn from context and broadly construed , is controlling .
16936	The courts have not defined `` minimal amounts , '' but publishers , I understand , take it to mean about 50 words .
16941	Mr. Masson then brought a libel suit against Ms. Malcolm , the New Yorker and Knopf .
16942	As a public figure , Mr. Masson had to prove malice and , as proof of malice , Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated .
16943	The quotes could not be found on the tapes , and the two judges who decided the case for Ms. Malcolm and her publishers conceded that , for the purpose of their decision , `` we assume the quotations were deliberately altered . ''
16944	For all historians and most journalists , this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the Malcolm articles .
16945	But Judge Arthur Alarcon , joined by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall , took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks .
16946	In his eloquent dissent , Judge Alex Kozinski observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said , the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words purged of `` uh '' and `` you know '' and grammatical error .
16951	But , as Judge Kozinski noted , the context shows that Mr. Masson 's `` me alone '' remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else .
16954	The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson 's description of himself as a `` private asset but a public liability '' to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory .
16955	Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that `` for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is ... a devastating admission of professional dishonesty . ''
16956	These were only two of a series of fabrications that had , in Judge Kozinski 's words , the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson `` appear more arrogant , less sensitive , shallower , more self-aggrandizing , and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements . ''
16957	As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm 's book , Mr. Masson emerges `` as a grandiose egotist ... and , in the end , a self-destructive fool .
16962	Should the green light Judges Alarcon and Hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice , it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens .
16964	Masson has lost his case , but the defendants , and the profession to which they belong , have lost far more . ''
16968	Mr. Schlesinger is Albert Schweitzer professor of the humanities at the City University of New York and a winner of Pulitzer Prizes in history and biography .
16975	The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the `` smart set , '' whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken , and the religious fundamentalists , whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives .
16976	Few now recall the actual outcome : Scopes was convicted and fined $ 100 , and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law .
16977	So it was with the Hiss case a generation later , when Alger Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served .
16983	It presents no great issue of legal principle , no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt .
16984	Instead , it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of `` who did what to whom . ''
16985	It is difficult , if not impossible , for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy .
16987	So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many , not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world .
16990	But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly , many of Dr. Morgan 's supporters have taken Thurber 's memorable title `` The Male Animal '' quite literally .
16992	A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case .
16997	Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government .
16998	The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons , and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do .
17001	Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed Congress with almost unimaginable speed , before the judicial process had run its course , and , indeed , while the Morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court .
17002	The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex , class , race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan 's particular situation .
17003	It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence .
17005	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it awarded General Dynamics Corp. a $ 64 million contract to launch the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite in June 1990 .
17008	Ronald J. Taylor , 48 , was named chairman of this insurance firm 's reinsurance brokerage group and its major unit , G.L. Hodson & Son Inc .
17009	Robert G. Hodson , 65 , retired as chairman but will remain a consultant .
17010	Stephen A. Crane , 44 , senior vice president and chief financial and planning officer of the parent , was named president and chief executive of the brokerage group and the unit , succeeding Mr. Taylor .
17019	Arby 's is the marketing , franchising and service company for the 2,100 restaurants in the chain .
17020	Stevric 's principals , Richard and Steven Buckley , said they led the acquisition group that acquired the Nathan 's Famous Inc. restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company .
17021	Richard Buckley said Stevric 's acquisition of Arby 's `` would allow seasoned franchisers and food-service operators , with no conflicts of interest , to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company 's energies toward growth .
17022	General Motors Corp. 's big defense and automotive electronics unit , GM Hughes Electronics , said net income fell 22 % in the third quarter , reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production .
17029	The earnings drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM 's North American automotive operations , which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit .
17030	Profit at the unit fell to $ 110.6 million , or 37 cents a share , from $ 142.4 million , or 45 cents a share , largely because of a $ 24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end .
17034	In the nine months , GM Hughes net fell 6.6 % to $ 486.6 million , or $ 1.48 a share , from $ 521 million , or $ 1.58 a share .
17038	GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35 % in the U.S. , largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales .
17039	GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM 's operations and attributed to the company 's traditional common stock .
17041	At EDS , third-quarter profit jumped 16 % to a record $ 110.9 million , or 93 cents a share , from $ 95.9 million , or 79 cents a share .
17043	In the nine months , EDS earned $ 315.8 million , or $ 2.62 a share , up 13 % from $ 280.7 million , or $ 2.30 a share .
17053	Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state .
17054	The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos , the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case , because the company 's stockholders , unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans .
17060	Geoffrey Kalmus , counsel to the official creditors committee , said that under the United Illuminating plan , unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $ 855 million , accrued before PS of New Hampshire 's Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection .
17065	It would be 72%-owned by United Illuminating holders and 28%-owned by current holders of PS of New Hampshire preferred and common stock .
17066	PS of New Hampshire preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock .
17071	The other bidders , New England Electric System , Westboro , Mass. , and PS of New Hampshire , did n't change the value of their bids , although PS of New Hampshire changed its rate proposal .
17072	New England Electric values its offer at $ 2 billion and PS of New Hampshire values its reorganization plan at $ 2.2 billion .
17074	However , creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like .
17083	The bids and rate proposals generally assume the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed , will go into operation .
17087	In a separate development , PS of New Hampshire gave 60 managers severance agreements that would pay one to three years ' salary if their jobs were changed or they were dismissed in the wake of a takeover .
17089	C. Hyde Tucker will become president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic International Inc. , a unit of this telecommunications concern , effective Jan. 1 .
17090	Mr. Tucker , 56 years old , is currently vice president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic 's C&P Telephone unit .
17092	Richard Breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone .
17093	It was , after all , only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
17096	With other anxious calls pouring in , he recalls , `` I 'd either have to disconnect the New York Stock Exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk . ''
17098	Now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office , and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk .
17103	In an interview and in congressional testimony , he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market .
17104	A veteran of another financial crisis , the savings-and-loan bailout , Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls .
17105	More broadly , he wants to `` modernize '' regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market .
17106	He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs , an area the SEC does n't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress .
17112	He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules .
17114	Mr. Breeden 's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the SEC 's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street .
17116	Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill , and the relationship generally remains warm .
17118	These days , Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday 's harrowing morning session .
17119	As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence , Mr. Breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies .
17121	Some in Washington contend that it 's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC .
17123	`` It was a fairly stressful weekend , but my sense is if you had n't had Richard Breeden there , it would n't have made much of a difference . ''
17142	With the touch of a button , drivers can choose from lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents , all blown in through the car 's air-conditioning system .
17143	The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud employee says Mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two .
17145	Here you can find Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displaying a `` live fish transporter , '' a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels , and Nissan Motor Co. with its `` keyless '' Boga , whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner 's fingerprints .
17146	Suzuki Motor Co. 's Escudome sport vehicle features a pop-out rear tent and invites drivers to go `` back to the nature . ''
17147	But this biennial event , the world 's largest display of cars and trucks , has its serious side , including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle-suspension systems .
17148	It 's also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged , and therein lies the draw .
17149	Even the biggest auto shows in the U.S. are largely regional affairs , but the Tokyo show is international .
17151	Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as Motor City executives , including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald , flocked to see the future .
17152	Even the Soviet Union came , for the first time in 24 years , to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' model .
17153	Here 's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported , and what the foreign visitors saw .
17155	The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road .
17156	These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride .
17157	Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts .
17158	Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .
17160	Nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan , and Toyota 's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring .
17163	In the engine department , several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space , allowing for shorter hoods .
17164	In the so-called two-stroke engines , which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage , each piston goes up and down only once to provide power .
17165	By contrast , the pistons in conventional four-stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .
17166	The two-stroke engine displays by Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries , the maker of Subaru cars , drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives , who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines .
17168	Honda says the five-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a four-cylinder , and the power of a V-6 .
17169	It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury Acura line in the U.S. , but Honda officials would n't comment .
17171	There 's plenty of whimsy here , but it is n't always clear whether it 's intentional .
17172	The show 's symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility .
17173	But the sponsors have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a snail , '' they say , `` important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . ''
17174	Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names , but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low .
17175	Honda has a tiny motorcycle called the Monkey , and a slightly larger cousin , the Gorilla .
17177	Mazda has the Bongo truck and , under its Autozam nameplate , a `` microvan '' called the Scrum .
17178	Its buglike Carol minicar is `` designed with softness , gentleness and warmheartedness . ''
17180	One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker , which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear .
17181	Daihatsu also has the Fellow 90 , the Leeza Spider and the Hijet Dumbo .
17184	The name is supposed to connote feminine grandeur , but in Japanese it means `` eyeglasses . ''
17189	General Motors Corp. is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years , and it includes a boxy Buick station wagon with wood-grain side panels .
17190	Ford and Chrysler also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less-popular automotive parts section .
17191	`` We 've got to get out of the Detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality , '' declares Charles M. Jordan , GM 's vice president for design , in explaining his pilgrimage to the Tokyo Show .
17194	True , Ford was declared the winner Sunday , but only after the Honda driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds .
17197	Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ?
17198	The Republicans maintain that a 30 % capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings .
17202	It 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive .
17205	PWA , which recently merged Wardair 's operations with those of PWA-owned Canadian Airlines International Ltd. , Canada 's second-biggest airline , said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt .
17206	PWA would n't estimate the value of Wardair 's aircraft , which include 12 Airbus A310-300s and three Boeing 747-100s .
17208	Mr. Ireland said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA also said it plans to sell , beginning in 1992 , have a current half-life value of about $ 34 million each , or a total $ 374 million , raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ 1.02 billion .
17211	Under its revised fleet plan , PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994 , and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year .
17213	PWA did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul , but a Toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $ 450 million -LRB- US -RRB- , excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA plans to sell , and purchase costs for as many as 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft that PWA previously ordered .
17215	It 's focused on streamlining '' PWA 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs , the analyst said .
17216	PWA 's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$ 1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter , nearly double the year-earlier figure , reflecting debt absorbed under the Wardair purchase .
17219	This British banking and financial-services group 's investment-banking arm , Barclays de Zoete Wedd Group , announced the following appointments at its merchant-banking subsidiary Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd .
17223	Callum McCarthy , 45 , was named to the new post of deputy head of the corporate-finance division and a managing director .
17224	Mr. Pimlott and Mr. McCarthy join Barclay 's from Kleinwort Benson Ltd. where they served as directors .
17225	The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements .
17228	Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett , who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . ''
17230	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the Fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply .
17231	Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal -LRB- D. , N.C. -RRB- that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years .
17232	`` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal 's monetary policy subcommittee .
17233	The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton -LRB- D. , Ind. -RRB- and Byron Dorgan -LRB- D. , N.D. -RRB- -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed .
17234	In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy .
17237	But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value .
17238	Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate , currently about 4 1\/2 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . ''
17239	In other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years .
17242	Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter .
17245	Reps. Hamilton and Dorgan also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the Treasury secretary to the 12-member Fed committee that makes monetary policy .
17246	Instead , the bill simply calls for twice-a-year meetings between the committee and top administration officials .
17247	Even that met with Mr. Greenspan 's disapproval because it might subject the Fed `` to a more intensely political perspective '' and `` could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals . ''
17249	Mr. Greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy , he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates .
17251	The do-it-yourself show , slated to start airing by June 1990 , marks Sears 's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products .
17255	With Mr. Vila as host , `` This Old House '' became one of the Public Broadcasting Service 's top 10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the network 's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers .
17260	`` Last season , we did a story that involved spending $ 700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast . ''
17264	Ogilvy & Mather in Chicago , a unit of WPP Group PLC , will handle the advertising account and syndication .
17265	The only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of Time-Life home improvement and repair books .
17270	He is president and chief executive officer of Comerica Inc. in Detroit .
17272	The proposed changes , which are scheduled to be announced today , would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods , according to federal officials .
17273	Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal .
17277	The Bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them .
17278	The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides , with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly .
17280	Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year 's Alar scare , when the EPA was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen , a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier .
17281	The agency has since acted to remove Alar from the nation 's grocery shelves by May 31 , 1991 , and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical .
17286	-- Give the EPA more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace .
17290	Chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred , but those that fall below these levels would be allowed .
17292	Financial markets took a midweek break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly , bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged .
17294	Long-term Treasury bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of $ 4.52 billion in 30-year bonds offered by the Resolution Funding Corp. as part of the government 's bailout of the savings and loan industry .
17295	The dollar was barely changed against the West German mark and up marginally against the Japanese yen .
17296	Yesterday 's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices Tuesday after the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. once again collapsed .
17299	Bond investors paid close attention to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who was testifying before a congressional hearing , but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the Fed 's monetary policy .
17303	But an unexpected deviation either way could roil bond and currency markets .
17309	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year issue rose less than an eighth of a point , or less than $ 1.25 for each $ 1,000 of face amount .
17312	In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen , compared with 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen Tuesday .
17313	A few years ago , I was on a panel of journalists that discussed the `` image '' of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others .
17315	Competition could be maintained -- and stadiums probably would remain full -- if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students , we said .
17318	`` I 'd love to see sports cut back , and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools , but everybody 's afraid to make the first move , '' he confided .
17319	`` It 's like the U.S. and the Russians : Nobody wants to disarm first . ''
17320	And so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court , while the casualties mount .
17322	They are : `` A Payroll to Meet : A Story of Greed , Corruption and Football at SMU '' -LRB- Macmillan , 221 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- by David Whitford ; `` Big Red Confidential : Inside Nebraska Football '' -LRB- Contemporary , 231 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- by Armen Keteyian ; and `` Never Too Young to Die : The Death of Len Bias '' -LRB- Pantheon , 252 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- by Lewis Cole .
17324	It chronicles how , over a period of a dozen years , Southern Methodist University bought its way to football respectability in the Southwest Conference , only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete-payoff system it created .
17329	One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 bills that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached .
17331	It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's president .
17332	There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to Bill Clements , then a university governor -LRB- and now the governor of Texas ! -RRB- and oil man Edwin Cox , chairman of the board of trustees .
17336	Mr. Whitford drew on voluminous news media coverage of the SMU scandal , and on a university internal investigation .
17337	Mr. Keteyian had to do most of his own digging on University of Nebraska football , which is , to date , high and dry as far as the NCAA is concerned .
17339	Discrepancies go unexplained in `` Confidential '' -LRB- one ex-player claims he received $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars -RRB- , and when Mr. Keteyian ca n't nail down something , like who really owned a car driven by Husker tailback Doug Dubose , he simply reprints his notes .
17340	There are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between Husker players and a low-level female university employee .
17343	Dean Steinkuhler , a spectacularly bulked-up former lineman , confesses that he used 'em , and says other Huskers did too .
17348	Bias 's coach , Lefty Driesell , ordered the room in which Bias died to be cleaned before the police could arrive -LRB- the order was n't carried out -RRB- , and the school 's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players .
17353	Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court .
17355	Mercedes-Benz , which had said it did n't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts , did n't explain its change of heart .
17358	The amount covers taxes , interest and penalties owed from 1966 , when the state began collecting corporate taxes , to 1985 .
17360	Under Massachusetts tax laws , corporations must pay 9.5 % of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities , including warranties , customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships .
17362	As part of the plan , the Houston-based company 's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused to target black , Hispanic , upscale or core middle-class customers .
17363	Stores in upper-income neighborhoods , for instance , will carry high-priced wines , publications such as Vanity Fair , gourmet pasta sauces , oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products .
17364	Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish-language magazines , Mexican cooking items and candies .
17365	Stores in the company 's core middle-class market will get more frozen and quick-to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water .
17366	V.H. Van Horn , National Convenience president and chief executive officer , said the move reflects the company 's realization that the industry 's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want -- rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores .
17368	Analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who pops into a convenience store for a sandwich , cigarettes , soda or beer .
17371	National Convenience 's move is likely to be echoed by other chains , though analysts note that Southland Corp. , owner of 7-Eleven stores , and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort .
17372	Still , Southland said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years , and that the company has begun to follow suit .
17373	For instance , Southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets .
17374	Several months ago , it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores , a spokeswoman said .
17377	Analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores , allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't .
17379	Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the United Mine Workers and Pittston Co .
17381	Previous talks between Pittston , of Greenwich , Conn. , and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful .
17383	Pittston seeks changes in health and pension benefits , among other things .
17384	No schedule for formal talks was set , but meetings are expected to begin soon .
17385	One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie , its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a `` significant '' drop next year in sales of its core product .
17387	In addition to the forecast , the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead .
17389	Delmed , which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease , on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich , chairman , president and chief executive officer , and of Leslie I. Shapiro , chief operating officer and chief financial officer .
17390	They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , which owns about 45 % of Delmed .
17391	At the same time , the New Brunswick , N.J. , company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S. , National Medical Care Inc .
17396	Delmed said yesterday that Fresenius USA would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels .
17398	Fresenius , a West German pharmaceutical concern , has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % .
17399	The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed .
17409	The water destroyed about $ 75 million in currency and caked $ 4 million of coins with mud , rendering them dangerous to counting machines .
17410	The $ 75 million in paper money , although moldy , mildewy and smelly , was exchanged through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia without incident .
17413	The U.S. Mint would n't take the coin because it was n't mutilated , and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts only clean coins , he says .
17414	The Philadelphia Fed says it is merely an `` agent '' for coins , responsible only for storage and distribution .
17421	A giant heater , working like a blowtorch , causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers .
17422	After clanging around for an hour or so , the shiny , hot money pours out of the cement chute , where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers .
17426	In fact , there 's only one person involved who 's happy , and that 's Floyd String , president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution .
17427	Not only did his company find $ 20,000 worth of work , but when the approach was suggested , Mr. String says , Brooks officials `` did n't laugh at me or anything .
17428	`` Parenthood , '' this summer 's successful and amusing movie about parents and children , apparently was only the beginning .
17429	It seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother 's death , or adoption , or aging parents , or pregnancy .
17431	Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen -- have taken a cue from Chekhov : When it comes to compelling drama , there 's no place like home .
17435	Yet there will be people who will sob at `` Immediate Family , '' a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption .
17436	These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles , no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told .
17439	Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive parents -LRB- Glenn Close and James Woods -RRB- and the teen-age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption -LRB- Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon -RRB- .
17440	Linda and Michael -LRB- Ms. Close and Mr. Woods -RRB- , who seem to be pushing 40 , live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle .
17441	All of their friends have children and they ca n't , so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment .
17443	Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility , Linda and Michael decide to adopt .
17444	The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one -- or maybe they 're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script , and Jonathan Kaplan 's -LRB- `` The Accused '' -RRB- dull direction .
17446	The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother , so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy 's -LRB- Ms. Masterson -RRB- bus ticket from Ohio .
17449	Lucy , of course , is pretty and smart , though uneducated .
17451	There is some pain , when Lucy has the baby and `` did n't know she would feel like this '' and wants to keep the baby .
17458	They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction , like tourists cataloging the sights they 've seen from the window of a bus .
17463	Bruce Willis 's best attribute as an actor is his coy , lazy voice , and that 's all you get of him here , speaking for the baby .
17467	To be sure , one wonders what kind of man is this , who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling .
17476	Westinghouse Electric Corp. , capitalizing on a major restructuring program , expects operating margins of more than 10 % and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year , top officers told securities analysts here .
17477	John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5 % annually through the next three years .
17478	In 1988 , the company earned $ 822.8 million , or $ 5.66 a share , on sales of $ 12.49 billion .
17480	In the past 20 months alone , Paul E. Lego , president and chief operating officer , said the divestiture of $ 300 million of slow-growth , low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $ 600 million in profitable acquisitions .
17482	Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2 % to 2.5 % , `` we can handle that , '' Mr. Marous said .
17483	GNP is the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services .
17488	Westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers .
17495	Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse 's 55 % stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter .
17499	Because of an error by the National Association of Securities Dealers , the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday 's edition .
17500	A proposed conflict-of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures , say financiers , researchers and university administrators .
17501	The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses -- or lose their government money .
17503	As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years , governmental fear of abuse has risen .
17504	But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
17505	The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 .
17508	With $ 2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .
17509	The researchers , who are being financed by the Lithox funds , will receive a royalty , or percentage of sales , if their research yields a commercial product .
17513	Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
17514	While Ms. Kaddurah-Daouk left MIT to head Amira , Prof. Schimmel will continue to work at MIT , serve on Amira 's board and own a small equity stake in the company .
17521	Last year , venture capitalists spent an estimated $ 600 million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses , according to the National Venture Capital Association , a trade group .
17522	Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties .
17527	Last year , for example , Avalon and others invested $ 14 million in Athena Neurosciences Inc. , South San Francisco , Calif. , to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain .
17529	Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it .
17531	The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital , entrepreneurs say .
17532	If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern .
17533	Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
17534	For its part , NIH insists that its guidelines `` should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use . ''
17535	Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists , says Katherine Bick , who oversees the huge NIH grants program as its deputy director for extramural research .
17540	Among other provisions , the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research .
17541	Ms. Bick , the NIH administrator , says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be `` ideas for discussion . ''

17554	Aidan Quinn , Brian Dennehy and Stockard Channing are excellent in this gripping tale of a reluctant witness in an organized crime prosecution .
17555	It 's set in New York , but it resonates with the terrible dynamics of the Latin American drug wars .
17557	No doubt there is something to irk everyone in this AT&T-sponsored dramatization of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 's book about Watergate .
17558	Personally , I 'm irked by its combination of ponderousness and timidity , which adds up to an utter lack of drama .
17559	Sunday , Oct. 29 , 10-11 p.m. EST , on Showtime -LRB- repeated Nov. 2 , 6 , 11 and 15 -RRB- : `` The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . ''

17583	The Ku Klux Klan was revived in the 1920s as a national organization aimed at Catholics and Jews as well as blacks .
17584	One reason for its downfall was the murder trial of D.C. Stephenson , an Indiana leader whose reckless career is depicted in this film starring Mel Harris -LRB- `` thirtysomething '' -RRB- and John Heard .
17591	L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain .
17601	`` The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker , but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer . ''
17602	Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , were unavailable for comment .
17603	In a statement , Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season , necessitated our filing Chapter 11 . ''
17604	The jewelry chain , which is based in Sacramento , Calif. , had revenue of $ 62 million and operating profit of $ 2.5 million for the year ended June 30 .
17609	Renaissance declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday , timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm .
17614	When it owns stocks , Renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades .
17615	The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price .
17617	In Tuesday 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day , but finished with less than a four-point loss .
17618	Renaissance 's last portfolio shift , carried out by Goldman , Sachs & Co. , was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills .
17619	The sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock market , came when Renaissance 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and Treasury bills .
17625	`` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better value all the time , '' Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday .
17631	But everything is relative to Mr. Terrizzi , so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills , even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in January .
17635	Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation .
17636	Competing asset-allocation firms march to their own computer models , so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while Renaissance has sat on the sidelines .
17638	Mr. Terrizzi confirms some clients have left Renaissance , but no major ones , and the firm has added new accounts .
17639	David Evans , who last week resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. `` for personal reasons '' just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection , has been temporarily reappointed to both positions , the company said .
17640	Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd , 37 years old , would join the nine-member board .
17642	Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found , but not later than the end of the year , the company said .
17643	It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM\/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company .
17645	And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating .
17652	Later in the day , according to the source , the board reversed itself , decided to file for bankruptcy protection , and asked Mr. Evans to stay on .
17655	Last Monday , Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets .
17658	Qintex Australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment .
17665	Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill .
17669	MGM Grand Inc. has agreed to pay $ 93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas , Nev. , Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort .
17670	Of the total purchase price , $ 50 million cash and $ 30 million in stock -LRB- nearly 1.8 million shares -RRB- would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel & Casino from Southwest Securities , a Nevada limited partnership .
17671	The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course , a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc. , of Phoenix , Ariz. , and the Jaffe family , and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian .
17673	The luxury airline and casino company , 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. , earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties , but did n't disclose the purchase price .
17674	The proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand 's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million , of which 72 % will be owned by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda , according to the prospectus .
17676	Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company 's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas , refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit , and to acquire the property for the new resort .
17677	The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about $ 32 million , and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft , made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. , will cost around $ 24.5 million .
17678	MGM Grand said the latest stock offering wo n't cover the $ 600 million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park , and added it will need to seek additional financing , either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings , at a later date .
17680	The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel , a multi-spired , castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space .
17681	The facility will be marketed toward families , and room rates will be between $ 35 and $ 55 a night , MGM Grand said .
17682	The prospectus did n't include many details about the studio and theme park , although conceptual drawings , released this month , show that it may feature several `` themed '' areas similar to those found at parks built by Walt Disney Co .
17687	The average seven-day compound yield , which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year , fell to 8.47 % , its lowest since late last year , from 8.55 % the week before , according to Donoghue 's .
17689	Money funds invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities , commercial paper and certificates of deposit , all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring .
17695	`` They 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them , slowly , '' said Walter Frank , chief economist for the Donoghue Organization , publisher of Money Fund Report .
17703	The average 30-day simple yield slid to 8.22 % from 8.26 % , and the average 30-day compound yield fell to 8.56 % from 8.60 % .
17704	Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year : They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market , and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money .
17713	Leverage is never a problem for the traditional `` open end '' mutual funds , which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all .
17715	The usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock , using the proceeds to buy additional bonds .
17723	`` If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold , '' says Gerald Perritt , editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago , they might shy away .
17724	In a typical leverage strategy , a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money .
17729	`` As long as I am borrowing at 9.9 % and each -LCB- bond -RCB- yields over that , it enhances the yield , '' he maintains .
17732	New America High Income Fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ 5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors .
17735	She declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund 's recent purchases , sales or cash position .
17742	Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year , says John Frabotta , portfolio co-manager .
17743	He says the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds .
17746	At the 50%-leveraged Zenith Income Fund , portfolio manager John Bianchi recently dumped Mesa Petroleum , Wickes and Horsehead Industries , among others , to raise his cash position to a record 15 % .
17750	`` We 're looking at the leverage factor every day , '' says Robert Moore , president of Bernstein-Macaulay Inc. , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and the fund 's adviser .
17753	And if she and the Battery Park City Authority have their way , her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden `` artwork '' in the downtown complex .
17755	It could cost taxpayers $ 15 million to install and BPC residents $ 1 million a year to maintain .
17756	Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens , South Gardens , as now planned , will die from congestive garden design .
17761	And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA , a New York State public benefit corporation : `` The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden , which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain . ''
17762	Undeterred , the BPCA hired Ms. Bartlett and another confessed garden ignoramus , the architect Alexander Cooper , who claimed he had never visited , much less built , a garden , and said of the project , `` I do n't view this as a landscape .
17765	The firm of Bruce Kelly\/David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park 's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden .
17768	She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees , water , landscape fragments , rudimentary square houses , circles , triangles , rectangles -- and fit them into a grid , as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall .
17769	But for South Gardens , the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them .
17770	In a letter to the BPCA , kelly\/varnell called this `` arbitrary and amateurish . ''
17773	As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design : `` I have designed a garden , not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip . ''
17775	And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method : Commissioning a friend to spend `` five or six thousand dollars ... on books that I ultimately cut up . ''
17777	`` I 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail . ''
17778	Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client `` because I do n't think you can do watered-down versions of things . ''
17781	The labels were breathy : `` Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design ... a rose garden , herb garden , serpentine garden , flower fields , an apple orchard ... organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form ` rooms ' ... here and there are simple architectural forms , a whimsical jet of water , a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid , and chairs of every sort to drag around ... .
17784	They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly .
17785	Ms. Bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or people .
17786	Kelly\/Varnell had put South Gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room , or about 100 humans overall .
17789	One she made into a topiary rec room , replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger , TV , piano and chairs .
17793	She ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting , and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans .
17794	In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit , a `` zinc sink , '' a `` huge fishbowl with carp '' and a `` birdcage with cockatoos . ''
17796	In another compartment called the Linden Bosque , 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet .
17798	One thing about the Bartlett plan was never in doubt : It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers , rosarians , orchardists and arborists .
17800	Furthermore , she had insisted on paths so narrow -LRB- five to eight feet -RRB- and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- could n't maneuver .
17803	Finally , flouting the BPCA 's wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside Esplanade , prized for its expansive views of New York Harbor , the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island , Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall , this time concrete , this time 10 1\/2 feet tall .
17804	She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront , blotting out the city 's great natural water features , the harbor and the river .
17805	-LRB- Within her garden , she has decreed a waterfall , a rill , ponds and other costly , trivial waterworks beside the Hudson . -RRB-
17807	The Parks Council wrote the BPCA that this `` too ` private ' ... exclusive , '' complex and expensive `` enclosed garden ... belongs in almost any location but the waterfront . ''
17809	By removing the hedges and some walls , the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up .
17810	It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants . ''
17813	The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small ` rooms ' insure ... that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime . ''
17816	Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals , Ms. Bartlett 's South Gardens design somehow continues on , seemingly impervious to reason , stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications .
17817	BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes to negotiate a seawall that could `` be significantly more visually permeable . ''
17818	And by substituting yet another landscape architect , Nicholas Quennell , he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the `` artistic vision '' of a `` truly great artist . ''
17821	There is still time , however , for Gov. Mario Cuomo or Fabian Palomino , chairman of the BPCA board , to prevent this topiary `` Tilted Arc . ''
17823	It is this adapting of absurd ` knots ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants .
17826	During the latter part of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles .
17827	The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world .
17828	The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain .
17829	By contrast , in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union .
17830	The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency .
17831	It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined .
17833	One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws .
17840	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
17871	Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing `` circuit breakers '' to halt program trading at volatile times .
17872	Mr. Breeden , in his first testimony to Congress since taking the SEC post , said the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge , including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday .
17873	After the study , the SEC would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones , he added .
17874	Circuit breakers , designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements , curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points .
17877	Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee , is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb `` turmoil '' in the marketplace .
17878	He argued that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors .
17885	He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . ''
17888	Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs , and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms .
17893	K mart officials and Mr. Pilevsky would n't comment on the sale .
17895	Analysts are estimating third-quarter earnings will drop between 13 % and 20 % to about 50 to 55 cents per share , compared with 63 cents per share in the year-ago quarter .
17901	They are spread around the country and include locations in California , Florida , Washington and Arizona .
17903	The company is active in office and residential development in New York .
17906	The company typically sells the centers it develops , but has usually sold only one or several at a time .
17909	Now , thousands of mailers , catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash .
17910	`` We just do n't have the staff to -LCB- deliver -RCB- it , nor do we have the space or the time , '' says a spokesman for the Schaumburg , Ill. , electronics company , which has 5,000 employees in the Austin area .
17911	`` It 's the overload problem and the weight problem we have . ''
17913	Businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail , and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore -- literally .
17915	General Motors earlier this year said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its Flint , Mich. , office , while Air Products & Chemicals , Allentown , Pa. , says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing .
17918	According to the Direct Marketing Association , total direct mail -- to both businesses and consumers -- jumped 50 % to 65.4 billion pieces in 1988 from five years earlier .
17920	The deluge has spurred cost-conscious companies to action , with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it .
17922	After all , this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect , that is the butt of so many jokes that television 's `` L.A. Law '' portrays direct-mail-mogul David as short , bald , intensely nerdy , and unremittingly boring .
17923	The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail `` is a commonly known problem , and it 's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board , '' right down to the mail-room level , says Stephen Belth , a list consultant and chairman of the Direct Marketing Association 's business-to-business council .
17929	Magazines are n't delivered at all , even if an individual 's name is listed ; employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library -- and are told to change the subscriptions to their home addresses .
17930	At Air Products , meanwhile , the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away -- even if addressed to an individual .
17931	`` If they get 50 packets of something , they open one , see what it says , throw 48 away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate , '' a spokesman says .
17932	Direct marketers were especially alarmed when General Motors -- one of the country 's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself -- entered the junk-mail battle .
17933	As of March 1 , its Flint office , with about 2,500 employees , stopped delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines .
17939	They 're going to decide what their employees can or can not read . ''
17946	`` We 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter , '' says Jack Miller , president of Quill Corp. , a Lincolnshire , Ill. , business-to-business mail-order company .
17947	But then again , mailing less and smarter wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway .
17949	Hyundai Motor America , fighting quality complaints , declining sales and management turmoil , yesterday unveiled its 1990 ad strategy , tagged `` We 're Making More Sense Than Ever . ''
17951	TV ads plugging the company 's new V-6 Sonata and its souped-up Excel subcompact will begin appearing Monday .
17952	One spot shows a Sonata next to a rival midsized car , and an announcer says , `` Listen to what they 're saying about the Hyundai Sonata . ''
17953	As the announcer reads favorable quotes about the model from Motor Trend and Road & Track magazines , the other car , which is white , slowly turns green .
17957	EWDB , formed by the merger of Eurocom and Della Femina McNamee WCRS , said it agreed to buy Vizeversa , an agency in Barcelona .
17960	Seagram will run two interactive ads in December magazines promoting its Chivas Regal and Crown Royal brands .
17961	The Chivas ad illustrates -- via a series of pullouts -- the wild reactions from the pool man , gardener and others if not given Chivas for Christmas .
17962	The three-page Crown Royal ad features a black-and-white shot of a boring holiday party -- and a set of colorful stickers with which readers can dress it up .
17965	Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House .
17966	Nevertheless , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary .
17970	Their tone was good-natured , with Mr. Packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again .
17971	Although the proposal , authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , appears to have general backing by Republicans , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it .
17975	It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition .
17976	`` A number of us are not going to touch capital gains , IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction , '' said Sen. Charles Robb -LRB- D. , Va. -RRB- , who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains .
17986	Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell .
17988	Today , Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal .
17995	Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
17997	But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the House and the Senate .
18000	Japan plans to send the Chinese back home and is negotiating with the Chinese government , a Justice Ministry official said .
18009	The state Supply Regulator Institute is to burn rice , corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government , a statement from the information service SISAL said .
18012	Another 250 Libyans were already in Italy to stage a day of mourning for victims of Italy 's colonial rule between 1911 and 1943 , when Tripoli says Rome kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor .
18014	But officials in Rome say the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between Italy and King Idris , deposed by Col. Muammar Gadhafi in 1969 .
18016	Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting , a ministry spokesman said .
18018	The action , in the Canadian Federal Court , will be against Canada , the Netherlands , West Germany , Britain and the U.S. , the ministry spokesman said .
18019	Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation , an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said .
18021	Since then , the ministry has announced 50 bans on food imports from European countries , including Italy , Spain , Turkey , Greece and the Soviet Union .
18025	Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding .
18026	The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , who has yet to reply .
18027	AGIP refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year .
18031	The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an hour and requires recharging from a standard wall socket every 100 miles .
18033	Net income includes an extraordinary gain of about $ 100,000 from the reversal of bad debt and interest income .
18035	In the 1988 third quarter , the company posted a net loss of $ 876,706 , or 22 cents a share , on revenue of about $ 5.1 million .
18036	Total Assets plans and designs computer centers , computer security systems and computer backup systems .
18038	It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families .
18039	The institute 's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents .
18042	In 1986 , some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another .
18047	The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services ; collects patient fees ; receives money through contributions from individuals , foundations and bequests .
18048	The funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums , and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer .
18049	The Epilepsy Institute 's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily .
18050	This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious .
18051	But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people 's health care or for the cost .
18058	The buy-out group is headed by Paul R. Lederer , president of Parker 's automotive group , and includes several other executives of the three divisions .

18062	A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip : a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes .
18063	The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools , grottoes and waterfalls .
18067	In the lobby behind its nine-story , orchid-strewn atrium , a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks , stingrays , angelfish , puffers and other creatures of the deep .
18074	Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. 's $ 290 million Excalibur are going up .
18075	The Excalibur , with a castlelike hotel , jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions , will be able to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990 .
18076	If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $ 700 million movieland resort with a working studio , casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become Las Vegas 's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $ 1.6 billion .
18079	Still other projects that have been announced but not yet started could put expenditures above $ 3 billion over the next few years .
18080	Stephen A. Wynn , who owns 29.4 % of Golden Nugget 's shares , says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors .
18082	The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas 's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795 , or nearly 20 % , to 75,500 .
18085	Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms .
18089	Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines , crap tables or roulette wheels Las Vegas will add to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards here , much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services .
18090	`` Traffic is certainly a concern , as is pollution , water and an adequate labor market , '' says Frank Sain , executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau .
18092	This year , by one means of transport or another , more than 18 million people will visit the city .
18095	Amid a riot of jousting knights , circus clowns , gold-leaf centurions and creatures of the wild , lesser competitors will fall .
18096	Caesars World Inc. plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $ 190 million into its opulent Caesars Palace , next door to the new Mirage , and adding a $ 100 million shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive .
18097	The Palace , with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers , is already well-known for its Caesarean theme .
18098	The Flamingo Hilton , Imperial Palace , Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts , new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up .
18101	Other casino owners , Circus Circus among them , are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada .
18104	Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high .
18110	`` Two generations ago , Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion , '' says Van Heffner , executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association .
18113	Only a decade or so ago , casino managers balked at in-room TV sets and other fripperies that distracted from gambling .
18114	Casinos today offer bowling alleys , water parks , golf courses , tennis courts , lush swimming pools and other diversions , and more such facilities are being designed .
18117	For now , however , the naysayers ' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip .
18118	This is no place for pedestrians , but at 7:30 on a recent morning , when construction choked traffic at the famous Four Corners intersection to one lane , a taxi passenger found it faster to abandon the cab and walk to her destination .
18119	The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership .
18121	The Dunes , the Aladdin and the Riviera were all acquired by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession , in the early 1980s .
18126	Many blue-collar customers of downtown 's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to Laughlin , Nev. , a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd .
18127	Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels .
18130	`` There 's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year , but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates , '' says Paul Rubeli , casino executive at Ramada Inc. , which runs the Tropicana .
18133	Mr. Wynn seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit , but some securities analysts doubt it .
18134	Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp. 's Bally Grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties .
18138	Its parking lot is inconvenient , the MGM lion's-head logo still appears in places , and customers still call it the Grand , rather than the Bally Grand .
18139	It has a `` great location , but they 're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens , '' says Daniel Lee , a Drexel analyst .
18145	The Circus Circus lures them with low room rates , inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge .
18151	While his company 's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms , it has decreased the number of its rooms .
18153	Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad , who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage , the Las Vegas Hilton and others .
18154	Other , smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- Hawaiian tourists , for example , or the local trade .
18156	Off the Strip , MarCor is building the Rio , a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites .
18158	`` The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers , with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor , are gone , '' Mr. Sain of the visitors ' bureau says .
18165	Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it becomes a Law , be presented to the President of the United States ; If he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal , and proceed to reconsider it .
18166	If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill , it shall be sent , together with the Objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a Law ... .
18168	Every Order , Resolution , or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of Adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the Same shall take Effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill .
18170	Vice President Quayle and Budget Director Darman said recently they 've joined the search .
18172	President Bush does n't have any provision in mind , but line-item-veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing Resolution .
18175	The 1974 budget `` reform , '' passed over President Nixon 's veto , took away the presidential impoundment power , thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto .
18177	Article I , Section 7 , Clause 3 says that whether it 's called an `` order , resolution or vote '' or anything else , Presidents must have the chance to veto .
18179	Finding a test case should n't be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible .
18180	The White House had the perfect case , but Congress blinked before it could go to court .
18181	After the HUD and S&L stories broke , some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble .
18182	They worried about an Interior Department directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs .
18183	Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation : `` None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff . ''
18186	The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year , `` This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1 , 1989 . ''
18191	There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen to join treaty-negotiating teams and new restrictions on OMB .
18192	Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets , but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers .
18194	And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people . ''
18200	Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $ 40 million in military bases for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $ 70 million for bases in Tennessee .
18201	President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work .
18202	He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork .
18203	Congress may have lost any sense of discipline , but that does n't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess .
18205	Troubled SCI Television Inc. proposed to restructure much of its $ 1.3 billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations .
18207	KKR also signaled to the company 's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights .
18209	They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems .
18216	Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , SCI TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar .
18218	While one big SCI TV investor thinks that 's pretty generous , many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV .
18221	It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due ; the grace period for paying the bill expires Nov. 16 .
18226	Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress , most often associated with the real estate market in the Southwest , are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving Northeast .
18228	The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of Prussia , Pa. , have advertised for new financing .
18229	Rising office vacancy rates in Fairfield County , Conn. , have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans .
18231	Many troubled properties have n't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify , says Albert I. Berger , who heads the Secaucus , N.J. , office of Helmsley-Spear Inc. , a real estate brokerage .
18235	But in today 's overbuilt market , tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that squeeze building owners .
18239	Tokyu Development Corp. is spending $ 500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban Tokyo with rarely seen back yards , front yards , swimming pools and tennis courts .
18243	Buyers with $ 6 million to spend can select from 11 designs , including a Mediterranean-inspired California style , a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect Frank Lloyd Wright .
18244	There are spacious living rooms and baths , plus a master grandparents suite and a foyer for removing shoes to suit Japanese life styles .
18245	Exteriors are faced with brick , wood or stone , but the homes are made of steel-reinforced concrete .
18246	`` We were disappointed we could n't use wood , '' says architect Walter J. Richardson , `` but the Japanese only want stronger materials . ''
18250	`` One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company , or starting a new line in the fashion business , '' says L. Robert Lieb president of Mountain Development Corp. in West Paterson , N.J .
18252	`` It 'll never be like what Bristol-Myers does , '' he adds , `` but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks . ''
18253	Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc. of Manalapan , N.J. , has built Cross Creek Pointe , Allegro Pointe and other Pointes in New Jersey .
18254	Caspi Development Corp of Armonk , N.Y. , has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third .
18255	Developer Steve Caspi says the same brand name indicates consistent quality , `` regardless of location , design or amenities . ''
18258	Beacon Hill is for `` move-up '' town houses , and Nob Hill , for single-family houses .
18262	`` I think there 's a disease called buyer 's regret , and I 'm sure it 's running rampant at this moment , but it gets cured in a short period of time , '' says Kenneth Leventhal , co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Co. , a Los Angeles accounting firm specializing in real estate .
18267	`` The message is we build 'em right , '' says Peter Bedford , a California developer and officer at Urban Land Institute .
18271	`` It 's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged , '' says Michael Pacholik , sales manager of the LA Fitness club , Diamond Bar , Calif .
18274	The Association of Quality Clubs , which puts 1988 industry revenue at $ 5 billion , surveyed the health-conscious over-40 market and found that 43 % exercise regularly .
18278	He adds : `` The medical market and the fitness market parallel each other and are going to cross real soon . ''
18282	In the U.S. , radiation limits are set and monitored by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which licenses reactors that process the topaz .
18283	The agency is working on licensing importers but does n't currently monitor imports .
18288	Mr. Hickey added that the stones found in Hong Kong are thought to carry double the U.S. radiation limit , although he noted that double or even triple the U.S. limit is `` still in the range of safe levels . ''

18309	The commission believes that improving AM service would broaden listening selections and increase options for advertisers .
18313	The National Association of Broadcasters in June adopted an agenda for revitalizing AM radio that includes , among other things , pursuing further FCC action on selecting an AM stereo standard and seeking a law requiring all stereo receivers to include AM stereo .
18314	Listeners turned to radios run on batteries for news when the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo cut power lines .
18320	The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices , such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16 , and has increased chances for market crashes .
18321	Over the past nine months , several firms , including discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. and Sears , Roebuck & Co. 's Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit , have attacked program trading as a major market evil .
18324	The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire , computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options .
18325	The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves .
18327	Last month , program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day , or a record 13.8 % of the Big Board 's average daily volume .
18328	On Tuesday afternoon , Kemper told Bear , Stearns & Co. , General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. unit , Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage , officials inside and outside these firms confirmed .
18329	Kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be lengthened in the months ahead .
18331	`` Index arbitrage does n't work , and it scares natural buyers '' of stock .
18333	We 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're ruining the market .
18335	Kemper also blasted the Big Board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders .
18339	Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash .
18340	`` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it -LCB- program trading -RCB- , but they -LCB- the exchange -RCB- ca n't do it , '' he said .
18342	He said the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all the exchange can do is `` slow down the process '' by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers .
18344	Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody , the two biggest program trading firms , staunchly defend their strategies .
18346	`` We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week .
18347	Michael Carpenter , president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody , said in a recent interview , `` We do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole . ''

18412	Rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by BT Securities , a subsidiary of Bankers Trust New York Corp .
18414	`` The dress business has always been a gamble , but it 's never been like this , '' says Mr. Levy , president of St. Gillian Group Ltd. , which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy TV commercials .
18417	Campeau , owner of such retailers as Bloomingdale 's , Bon Marche , and Jordan Marsh , sidestepped financial collapse last month after an emergency $ 250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , a Canadian developer and a major shareholder in Campeau .
18418	The need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had been told at the company 's annual meeting in July that there were n't any major problems ahead .
18419	The risk of doing business with Campeau 's Federated and Allied department store chains is about to increase greatly , not only for Mr. Levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers , button suppliers , trucking firms and fabric houses .
18420	Next week , the country 's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing fashions for spring 1990 , the second most important selling season of the year .
18421	And as the applause dies down in showrooms along Seventh Avenue and Broadway , stylishly clad Campeau buyers will begin writing orders .
18427	But those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to Campeau stores .
18429	`` I 'm buying fabric right now for clothes which I may not be paid for until April or May .
18430	What happens to me if Campeau collapses between now and then ? ''
18431	Some credit concerns , such as Bernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc. , have told clients not to ship anything to Federated or Allied stores on credit .
18434	Other credit houses , such as Credit Exchange and Solo Credit Service Corp. , are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping .
18435	`` Payments are good right now , but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit , '' says Richard Hastings , a retail credit analyst , referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic .
18436	`` The Campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze . ''
18438	`` We 're being paid today , but we 're worried about tomorrow and will want '' letters of credit , says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified .
18440	I 'm going to ship and hope I get paid .
18442	Carol Sanger , vice president , corporate communications at Campeau , says that all of the Federated and Allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner .
18443	`` They continue to pay their bills and will do so , '' says Ms. Sanger .
18446	If goods are shipped to Bloomingdale 's between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20 , manufacturers expect to be paid by Nov. 10 .
18447	But manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until March , April or even May .
18454	This includes a working capital facility for Allied Stores of $ 350 million that matures March 15 , 1990 , and an $ 800 million bridge loan due April 30 , 1990 .
18456	In recent months , numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , including Bonwit Teller , B. Altman & Co. , and Miller & Rhoads Inc .
18457	Those filings , plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains , such as Saks Fifth Avenue , Marshall Field 's and Bloomingdale 's , have added to the anxiety .
18459	`` We expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week , but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders . ''
18463	Not only does your product have to be excellent , but you also have to be able to collect . ''
18465	Bud Konheim , president of Nicole Miller Inc. , says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the Federated and Allied chains .
18469	I 've got limited production , and I ca n't give it to underperformers . ''
18475	Bethlehem Steel Corp. , hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center customers , posted a 54 % drop in third-quarter profit .
18476	Separately , two more of the nation 's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses , marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry .
18477	Wall Street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of 1990 , when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines , such as rolled sheet used for cars , appliances and construction .
18480	Bethlehem , the nation 's second largest steelmaker , earned $ 46.9 million , or 54 cents a share .
18481	The figures include $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company 's coal operations .
18482	In the year-ago period , Bethlehem earned $ 101.4 million , or $ 1.27 a share , including a $ 3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt .
18486	It has n't diversified beyond steel , nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks .
18487	However , in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume , Bethlehem `` had pretty good earnings numbers , '' said Michelle Galanter Applebaum , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc .
18488	Ms. Applebaum had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share , but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected .
18489	Still , Bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ 58.6 million from $ 186.4 million a year ago , when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing .
18490	The company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers , a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market .
18491	At the same time , production costs , compared with a year ago , were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs , which resulted from the company 's new labor pact effective June 1 .
18492	`` We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories , '' said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams .
18494	Armco , hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business , said third-quarter net income dropped 8 % to $ 33 million , or 35 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter .
18498	Moreover , the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market , higher production costs and a poorer product mix .
18500	National Intergroup , which owns 50 % of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ 8.6 million , or 33 cents a share , compared with a net loss of $ 50.3 million .
18502	The latest period includes gains of $ 9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward .
18505	The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves .
18506	However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike .
18510	Jack Kuehler , IBM 's president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
18515	IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
18518	A state-of-the-art plant cost $ 40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $ 500 million today because the technology is so complex .
18525	But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one .
18526	X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
18528	They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they 're not supposed to .
18529	But , assuming those problems can be overcome , they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s .
18530	Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. received a $ 65 million contract to outfit Continental Airlines ' 393 planes with the Bendix\/King Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System .
18533	Allied-Signal is a unit of Allied-Signal Inc. , a manufacturer with interests in aerospace , automotive products and engineered materials .
18535	In a stunning shift in direction , Provigo Inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business .
18537	In a related move , Pierre Lortie , chairman and chief executive , resigned .
18538	Mr. Lortie joined Provigo in 1985 and spearheaded the company 's drive to grow outside its traditional food business .
18540	Bertin Nadeau , newly appointed chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo , would n't say if Mr. Lortie was asked to leave .
18543	Mr. Nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of Unigesco Inc. , Provigo 's controlling shareholder .
18545	The three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and health-products distributor , a small sporting-goods chain , and a combination catalog showroom and toy-store chain .
18546	Investors and analysts applauded the news .
18550	`` The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie 's creation -LCB- and -RCB- his strategy did n't work , '' said Steven Holt , a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd .
18551	Provigo 's profit record over the past two years tarnished the company 's and Mr. Lortie 's reputations .
18552	For the six months ended Aug. 12 , Provigo posted net income of C$ 6.5 million , or eight Canadian cents a share , compared with C$ 18.1 million , or 21 Canadian cents a share , a year earlier .
18554	Last month , Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Provigo 's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance .
18555	Analysts are skeptical Provigo will be able to sell the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value , and are expecting write-downs .
18559	He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit .
18561	Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo , a new position .
18562	Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo 's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit .
18564	Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan lent some support to the dollar , but the U.S. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies .
18565	Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street .
18568	`` Our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' Mr. Greenspan said , referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy .
18573	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8353 marks , down from 1.8355 marks Tuesday , and at 141.52 yen , up from 141.45 yen late Tuesday .
18576	Many traders forecast a continuation of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict the U.S. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower .
18578	He predicts a downward move in dollar-mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar-yen , noting that there continues to be a large pool of Japanese investor interest in U.S. securities , which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around 140 yen .
18582	Some analysts reckon that the next quarter 's figures will present a more accurate picture of the U.S. economy , showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors , including housing starts and equities .
18586	Lawrence Insurance Group Inc. said it acquired United Republic Reinsurance Co. , a Houston property and casualty reinsurance company , from United Savings Association of Texas for $ 28 million .
18592	Lawrence Group also owns Lawrence Agency Corp. , Schenectady , N.Y. , an insurance agency and brokerage .
18597	But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and fractious unions : the pilots and machinists .
18600	One reason : banks -- likely to react to any new UAL deal with even more caution than the first time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan .
18601	`` United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike , '' said an executive at Fuji Bank , one of UAL 's large lenders .
18602	`` If you have both -LCB- labor -RCB- groups on strike , you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at . ''
18603	Just this past week , a leading Japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible .
18606	That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work .
18607	Thus , even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key .
18608	`` There 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions , '' said Richard Nye , of Baker , Nye Investments , a New York takeover stock-trader .
18610	Both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like .
18617	`` We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate -LCB- the pilot union 's -RCB- concerns and ours , '' said Brian M. Freeman , the machinists ' financial adviser .
18618	Mr. Freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders , an employee stake and , perhaps , an equity investment by a friendly investor .
18621	The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company .
18625	`` Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots ? '' she adds .
18627	She also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now , they still could come back at a later time and try to take control .
18629	In that way , the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake , or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal .
18630	The group did n't make a formal offer , but instead told UAL 's advisers before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share .
18633	The board and UAL 's management , he says , `` ca n't go back '' to business as usual .
18636	The Atlanta-based airline , the third largest in the U.S. , attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic , new international routes and reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines , which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring .
18637	For the quarter ended Sept. 30 , Delta posted net income of $ 133.1 million , or $ 2.53 a share , up from $ 100 million , or $ 2.03 a share , a year earlier .
18639	During the quarter , Delta issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair , and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan .
18644	Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
18646	America West would n't identify the entity , but said the payment was for the foreign company 's use of certain tax benefits in connection with America West plane purchases .
18649	For the nine months , America West posted earnings of $ 18.9 million , or 97 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 9.7 million , or 74 cents a share , a year earlier .

18656	Michael T. Carr , advertising director of Playboy magazine , was named publisher of National Lampoon and Heavy Metal magazines , succeeding George Agoglia .
18657	It was the first management change since film-makers Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson took control of National Lampoon Inc. in March .
18658	They are looking for a new editor for National Lampoon and are trying to sell Heavy Metal .
18659	Columbia Savings & Loan Association , reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market , announced a loss for the third quarter of $ 226.3 million , or $ 11.57 a share .
18660	For the quarter a year ago , Columbia reported earnings of $ 16.3 million , or 37 cents a share .
18662	The loss stems from $ 357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia 's $ 4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio , which includes about $ 3.7 billion of junk bonds , $ 400 million of preferred stock , and Treasury securities .
18665	For the nine months , losses totaled $ 212 million , or $ 10.83 a share , compared with net income of $ 48.7 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier .
18666	The results include a $ 130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value .
18667	Columbia also added $ 227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio , increasing general reserves to $ 300 million , or about 6.7 % of the total portfolio , as of Sept. 30 .
18669	Thrift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions .
18672	Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices .
18673	For its future strategy , Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities .
18676	But he said Columbia remains `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry , '' based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital .
18682	Columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements , despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end .
18683	Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6 % , and total equity was $ 457.9 million .
18684	The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs , which has a book value of $ 90 million .
18689	Anheuser , the world 's largest brewer and U.S. market leader , has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume .
18690	With the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales , however , the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry .
18691	Over the summer , Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time .
18693	The St. Louis company said major rivals , Philip Morris Co. 's Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. `` have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months '' on their premium brands , pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser 's Budweiser label in many markets .
18695	Anheuser-Busch announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2 % to $ 238.3 million , or 83 cents a share , from $ 226.5 million , or 78 cents .
18697	Anheuser said its new strategy -- started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990 .
18704	Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant , which last year accounted for about 41 % of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5 % in the current year .
18705	`` Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar , and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl , '' said Joseph J. Doyle , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
18708	Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement , and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending `` cola wars , '' unwarranted .
18709	Mr. Thompson calls discounting `` a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share , '' and projected that Anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle .
18710	Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings , which fell five cents a share short of his own projections , contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public .
18715	Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding market share to Miller and Anheuser .
18717	Stocks rose in London , but fell again in Frankfurt .
18730	Among pharmaceutical shares , Chugai lost 60 yen to 2,290 yen -LRB- $ 16.20 -RRB- , and Mochida fell 150 to 4,290 .
18734	Daiwa House also ended easier , but Misawa Home was firmer .
18735	Pioneer Electronic and Sony , both of which dominated buying earlier this month , continued to fall Wednesday .
18736	Pioneer was down 90 at 5,810 , and Sony lost 40 to 8,550 , down 10 % from its record set Oct. 11 .
18741	Dealers said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by market-makers looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market 's recent downtrend .
18751	Frankfurt prices closed sharply lower in thin dealings , hurt by the roller-coaster session on Wall Street Tuesday and worries about wage demands by the largest West German trade union .
18753	`` It was dead , listless , depressing and negative , '' said one trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt .
18754	`` There was little turnover and nothing to stimulate the market . ''
18757	For the 1990 wage negotiations , the IG Metall is demanding a further cut in the German workweek and steep wage increases , which could sharply increase the costs for German industry .
18758	`` All the positive figures on the economy are out already , and people are focusing more on the dangers for next year , mostly the wage talks and the -LCB- parliamentary -RCB- elections , '' the U.S. trader said .
18759	The market also shrugged off positive factors , such as higher bond prices and a slowdown in monetary growth in September , traders said .
18760	They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer , as trading volume is falling toward the end of the year and the market is becoming more volatile .
18761	In the auto sector , Bayerische Motoren Werke plunged 14.5 marks to 529 marks -LRB- $ 288 -RRB- , Daimler-Benz dropped 10.5 to 700 , and Volkswagen slumped 9 to 435.5 .
18764	Other banks were slightly more resilient , with Dresdner Bank shedding 4.8 to 320 , and Commerzbank slipping 2.5 to
18766	Share prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Brussels , Milan and Stockholm , and mixed in Amsterdam .
18767	Among Pacific markets , prices closed lower in Sydney , Seoul , Hong Kong , Manila , Singapore and Wellington .
18772	French chemicals group , Orkem S.A. , said Wednesday it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC , a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins .
18774	The remainder is held by the public and by family interests , a spokeswoman for the French group said .
18776	The Democratic-controlled House , by a margin of 51 votes , failed to override President Bush 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest .
18778	It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush .
18779	Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin , but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president , who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills .
18780	Yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills , an estimated $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health and Human Services .
18784	The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake .
18785	By a lopsided 97-1 margin , the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and , despite reservations , the House adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll call .
18788	The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans .
18789	The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity .
18790	In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
18792	The emergency assistance would n't be counted against a state 's normal allocation of annual highway funds , and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road , such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week 's earthquake .
18793	The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by Congress this fall and , since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1 , only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law .
18794	The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and , apart from the health and education measure vetoed by Mr. Bush , bills funding the District of Columbia and the entire U.S. foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues .
18795	The vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years , and though the Democratic leadership is ambivalent about how to address the abortion issue , the debate is increasingly measured in party terms .
18796	The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote .
18798	Only 42 GOP members opposed the president 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year .
18799	At a recent White House meeting , Rep. Silvio Conte -LRB- R. , Mass. -RRB- , the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee , argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto , and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position .
18802	New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent , GOP Rep. James Courter , who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent .
18803	In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers , Rep. Robert Dornan -LRB- R. , Calif . -RRB- lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the `` chutzpah '' to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion .
18807	Separately , the House last night approved a nearly $ 67 billion compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration 's ambitious space station in fiscal 1990 and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
18808	The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $ 124,875 , and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners .
18811	Rupert Murdoch acquired a 25 % stake in Grupo Zeta S.A. , the leading Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher said .
18816	Following its failure last month to win a license for one of Spain 's first three private television stations , Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing .
18817	With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas , Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines , including the popular Tiempo , Interviu and Panorama , and three regional dailies .
18821	ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ 5 million .
18823	The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday .
18824	The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million .
18829	The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE -- which involve the actual S&P stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets , and index options on the CBOE -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings .
18833	Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public .
18834	The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . ''
18839	Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors .
18840	The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders .
18841	In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .
18842	At the same time , only four securities firms have signed up with the Big Board to buy and sell ESPs as market makers , an unenthusiastic response .
18843	The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group 's First Boston Corp. unit , Morgan Stanley & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc. unit .
18850	With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say .
18853	Comprehensive Care Corp. , which has agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. , reported a $ 4.7 million loss for its Aug. 31 first quarter and said it is negotiating an extension of senior bank debt past its Oct. 18 due date .
18856	In the year-earlier quarter , Comprehensive Care earned $ 1.6 million , or 18 cents a share .
18857	Revenue in the latest quarter fell 17 % to $ 44 million from $ 53.2 million , the company said , reflecting poor utilization of the company 's facilities and its behavioral medicine contracts .
18858	Comprehensive Care shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of Care-Unit chemical dependency and psychiatric programs for about $ 58 million in cash , notes and stock of First Hospital , Norfolk , Va .
18860	Comprehensive Care said First Hospital had advised it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition , although it is n't assured the acquisition will be completed .
18862	First Hospital advised Comprehensive Care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow , and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at Comprehensive Care `` by the end of October . ''
18866	A group including New York investors Douglas A. Kass and Anthony Pedone holds the equivalent of a 12.6 % stake in H.H. Robertson Co. 's common shares outstanding , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
18867	Officials of Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson , which makes steel roofs , store fronts and building parts , declined comment .
18871	The group also is engaged in talks with third parties regarding obtaining financing to buy more shares , but no agreements have yet been reached , the filing said .
18875	After coming close to a partial settlement a year ago , shareholders who filed civil suits against Ivan F. Boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord , people familiar with the case said .
18880	However , less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the tangle of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with overlapping claims , there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart .
18881	A shareholders ' accord would provide the first restitution to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by Boesky & Co. , once the largest arbitrage fund in the U.S. .
18882	The plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which Mr. Boesky and his partnerships were dealing .
18883	Some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling .
18884	Stocks involved in the shareholder suits include Union Carbide , RJR Nabisco , American Natural Resources , Boise Cascade Corp. , General Foods Corp. , Houston Natural Gas and FMC Corp .
18886	Among the defendants are Mr. Boesky ; the now-defunct Ivan F. Boesky & Co. ; Mr. Boesky 's main underwriter , Drexel Burnham ; and Cambrian & General Securities PLC , a British investment fund once controlled by Mr. Boesky .
18887	Individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the Boesky partnership , the British fund and Mr. Boesky as defendants , while Drexel and other defendants would remain .
18894	The limited partners include insurance companies , financial institutions and individual investors .
18896	This is because a Delaware court earlier this year said that Drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners .
18899	Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $ 650 million , of which $ 350 million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs , including the limited partners , who claim they were injured by Drexel .
18905	He maintains that the information from the FBI will help him get his 1968 conviction vacated and his bail-jumping indictment dismissed .
18906	His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s .
18909	The judge said that if the FBI 's proposed schedule was followed in releasing the documents , `` a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his 3 1\/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files . ''
18911	FEDERAL COURTS URGED to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits .
18915	Complex cases , such as antitrust suits and many business disputes , would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving .
18916	Standard cases would require less judicial attention , and fast-track cases could be resolved quickly .
18917	The study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence , ranging from as much as 100 days for cases in the fast track to as much as 18 months for complex disputes .
18919	To take advantage of local expertise and custom , the study said , Congress should require each of the 94 federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases .
18921	It included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups , plaintiffs ' lawyers and defense attorneys , corporate counsel and law professors .
18925	Data Systems has five retail stores in the northeast , but specializes in selling personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to banks , brokerage firms and other big businesses based in the New York metropolitan area .
18926	John Fitzsimmons , chief executive officer of Data Systems , said the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $ 100 million this year .
18928	Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester , N.Y. , said its Lehn & Fink Products subsidiary was restructured to form two operating groups , one for household products such as cleaners and disinfectants and the other for do-it-yourself products such as wood finishes and stains .
18929	The Montvale , N.J. , unit said the new operating structure `` creates a more focused and responsive organization geared to effectively managing the size and scope of the unit 's current business . ''
18930	The consumer brands unit was absorbed by the photographic , pharmaceutical and chemical concern last year when it acquired Sterling Drug Inc .
18934	The New York-based company reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 5.1 million , or 10 cents a share , compared with a year-earlier net loss of $ 6.2 million , or 12 cents a share .
18936	The company said 80 % of its auction business is usually conducted in the second and fourth quarters , with the current quarter having begun `` extremely well .
18940	And now that the price has fallen below $ 19.65 , which many had said showed considerable resistance , some traders and analysts figure there 's little to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions .
18941	With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves , `` technicians are wanting to sell this stuff , '' said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp .
18944	That storm hit the Gulf Coast Oct. 13 , closing the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port for a time and preventing tankers from unloading .
18947	An AP-Dow Jones survey of integrated oil companies , independent refiners , and oil industry consultants indicates that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production to 22.2 million barrels a day in September .
18950	But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production does n't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that .
18955	GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
18956	Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength .
18959	Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&D Commodities , could be reached for comment .
18960	As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .
18963	Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices .
18964	`` Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there is n't enough grain in the pipeline , '' said Katharina Zimmer , a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York .
18965	The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month , and is expected to take delivery by year end , analysts said .
18967	Futures prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy .
18968	The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound , up 0.59 cent , but it rose as high as 74.20 cents .
18972	The rumor , which has been neither confirmed nor denied , has China buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near-term delivery .
18974	Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign .
18975	This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents .
18981	The market is drifting , at least partly , because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast , the two largest African producers .
18991	Richard D. Sutton , 64 years old , chairman of this bank-holding company , was named acting president and chief executive officer of the company and its First National Bank of Toms River subsidiary .
18993	He could n't be reached and a company spokesman would n't comment on the dismissal .
18994	Mr. Robertson was also removed from the board of First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County , another unit , and the Toms River bank .
18995	American Medical International Inc. said it has n't received any other offers to acquire the owner and operator of hospitals , and took another step toward completion of its $ 3 billion acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp .
18996	Earlier this month IMA , an investment group that includes Chicago 's Pritzker family and First Boston Corp. , submitted a reduced bid for American Medical after it could n't finance its initial offer .
18997	Under the new offer , IMA will pay $ 26.50 a share for 63 million shares , or about 86 % of the shares outstanding .
19000	Earlier , American Medical said it had been approached again by two other possible suitors , whom it would n't identify but who had previously submitted bids for the company .
19002	American Medical said its directors have approved what is , in effect , a draft of a solvency opinion on the acquisition , submitted by the Los Angeles-based investment banking and evaluation consulting firm of Houlian Lokey Howard & Zukin Inc .
19004	Separately , Moody 's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the ratings of American Medical 's senior and subordinated debt issues and those of its international affiliate .
19006	The ratings concern said the acquisition should result in pretax losses from operations because of increases in interest expense and charges for depreciation and amortization , but that it expects the losses to be reduced through productivity gains and above average growth of the company 's hospitals .
19007	Moody 's said the ratings anticipate a successful debt-reduction program and modest improvement in discretionary cash flow because of planned asset sales .
19009	American Medical International : Senior notes , sinking-fund debentures , Euromarket notes , Eurobonds , Swiss franc bonds , unsecured loan stock to Ba3 from Baa2 ; convertible subordinated debentures , notes , and sinking-fund debentures to B2 from Baa3 .
19012	Bay Financial Corp. , Boston , which has been reporting big losses and warning of a possible bankruptcy-law filing , said it was sued by a holder .
19013	The real estate investment trust said the `` purported class action suit , '' seeks `` damages and other remedies under federal securities law and state law . ''
19014	Gerald E. Wilson , corporate secretary and legal counsel , said the company would n't disclose further details .
19015	He declined to name the shareholder , the plaintiff 's lawyer or the court where the lawsuit was filed .
19016	Bay , which has substantial investments in the floundering Massachusetts market , reported a loss of $ 62 million , or $ 15.97 a share , for the fiscal year ended June 30 .
19019	Keith A. Tucker was named a director of this insurance and financial services concern .
19020	Mr. Tucker , 44 years old , is president of Trivest Securities Corp. and senior vice president of Trivest Inc. , closely held investment companies based in Miami .
19022	Torchmark also said that Samuel E. Upchurch Jr. , 37 , vice president and general counsel , was selected to serve the remainder of the term vacated by John S.P. Samford , who resigned as director .
19024	The giant foods , tobacco and brewing company said it will issue common-share purchase rights to shareholders of record Nov. 8 .
19025	Under certain circumstances , the rights would entitle Philip Morris holders to buy shares of either the company or its acquirer for half price .
19029	Beghin-Say S.A. said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt .
19030	The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40 % rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989 , excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests .
19031	Beghin-Say said the sale will be done in two parts and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs -LRB- $ 325 million -RRB- .
19037	The price in the proposal is $ 43.50 for each of the 4.9 million shares the parent does n't own , or $ 213.2 million .
19042	The unit , which is the holding company for Esselte 's non-Swedish units , accounted for 58 % of sales and 71 % of operating profit last year .
19043	Separately , Esselte Business Systems reported third-quarter net income fell 5.9 % to $ 9.5 million , or 46 cents a share , from $ 10.1 million , or 49 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
19045	House and Senate conferees agreed to continue production of Grumman Corp. 's F-14 and to provide more than $ 3.8 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative during the current fiscal year .
19046	Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days , provide a face-saving compromise for both the White House and House Democrats .
19049	President Bush and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking House efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system , which already has cost some $ 17 billion .
19050	Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and other Senate conferees have opposed the House cuts , stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the Pentagon 's budget .
19051	The Senate voted to authorize $ 4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year , but the House , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion .
19054	The decision to keep the embattled F-14 's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the House , and especially for Rep. Les Aspin -LRB- D. , Wis . -RRB- .
19057	But as part of the overall agreement , Grumman and its outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year 's budget .
19058	Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that the Navy 's F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets .
19059	But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the House , where members are intent on saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s .
19060	Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $ 1 billion for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles , according to congressional aides .
19062	The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber 's capabilities , but congressional aides said the accord wo n't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper , scaled-down version of the $ 70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the Pentagon .
19064	The Menlo Park , Calif. , company said net was $ 7.4 million , or 22 cents a share , down from $ 32.3 million , or 86 cents a share , a year ago .
19067	Analysts had expected Consolidated to post a slim profit , and the company 's stock was down only 25 cents to $ 30.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
19071	The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which plunged more than 80 points in early trading Tuesday and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close , fell 5.94 to 2653.28 in the latest session .
19074	Buying interest in Du Pont , which declared a stock split and a dividend boost , and certain other blue-chip issues gave the industrial average a better performance than broader indexes .
19076	The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 1.16 to 320.94 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid 0.53 to 189.52 .
19079	Traders said program activity was n't in evidence through most of the session , however , and Big Board volume dropped to 155,650,000 shares from about 238 million Tuesday as concerns about the potential for additional sharp swings in the market kept other trading in check .
19084	Du Pont , which announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 14 % , jumped 2 1\/2 to 117 3\/8 .
19087	American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3\/8 to 43 1\/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.5 million shares , Chevron advanced 1 3\/4 to 66 5\/8 on 2.3 million shares , Woolworth rose 1 to 58 5\/8 , Coca-Cola Co. gained 5\/8 to 72 1\/2 and Eastman Kodak added 3\/8 to 44 1\/2 .
19089	Its GM Hughes Electronics and financial-services units both reported that third-quarter earnings were down from a year earlier .
19091	Its third-quarter earnings were lower than analysts had forecast , and the company said it had lowered its projections for earnings growth through the end of 1990 because of planned price cuts .
19093	Disappointment with the company 's earnings for the quarter led Prudential-Bache Securities to reduce its 1989 and 1990 earnings estimates , according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report .
19098	Aetna Life & Casualty gained 1 3\/8 to 61 1\/8 , Cigna advanced 7\/8 to 64 3\/4 , Travelers added 1\/2 to 40 3\/8 and American International Group rose 3 1\/8 to 107 3\/4 .
19100	The company reported a third-quarter loss and said it is holding talks with its bank lenders for an extension on some overdue debt payments .
19106	AMR , which owns American Airlines , rose 3 3\/8 to 72 1\/4 ; USAir Group fell 1 1\/2 to 38 5\/8 , and Delta Air Lines rose 1\/2 to 66 1\/2 after posting higher earnings for the September quarter .
19108	Procter & Gamble went down 3 1\/2 to 130 , Dow Jones fell 3 1\/2 to 37 1\/2 and Rockwell International dropped 2 1\/8 to 25 .
19109	However , Atlantic Richfield preserved its twopoint advance in the previous session and added 1\/8 to 103 7\/8 .
19111	Goldman Sachs placed the stock back on its list of recommended issues , raised its 1990 earnings estimate and recommended that its clients shift funds from Kellogg to General Mills .
19121	Newell , which declared a 2-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 14 % , added 7\/8 to 49 3\/8 .
19126	The partnership , which had solicited takeover offers , said it failed to receive any adequate bids for all of its operations but is reviewing offers for individual properties .
19128	Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row , and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity , modernize factories and develop new products .
19130	The more factories and robots Japanese manufacturers add , the more they will be able to export , and the less their domestic customers will need to import .
19131	At Canon Inc. , for example , sales are up nearly 20 % this year ; so , the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances : It is increasing capital spending -- by 60 % .
19137	So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America 's .
19139	Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest rates , though up a bit recently , are still low .
19140	And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends , companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment .
19141	But some economists and government officials here are n't applauding .
19142	They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan 's or anyone else 's good .
19144	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending .
19147	Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings .
19148	The investment boom is mainly sparked , they say , by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply .
19151	The manufacturers said 14.2 % of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones , 17.5 % is to cut costs , 12.5 % is for research and development , and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes .
19160	Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and , to some extent , to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan .
19163	The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo .
19164	But whatever its effects on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand .
19165	Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s .
19166	Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .
19167	Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20 % this year largely because its expensive Cima , Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand .
19171	With demand growing and workers in short supply , many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation .
19172	Among them are the shipbuilders , which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market .
19177	Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , Daikin is building another plant , which will lift its production capacity 50 % .
19179	Besides , Daikin 's major competitors , Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , `` are all adding production lines , '' a Daikin spokesman says .
19184	Meanwhile , Toyota Motor Corp. 's $ 247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars , and Honda is spending $ 317 million on expansion .
19185	Mazda Motor Corp. is still considering its options , but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years .
19188	But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger , and big investments in `` domestic '' industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market .
19191	The product is n't widely used yet , but Toshiba , which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs , believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again .
19193	Meanwhile , Toshiba 's Japanese rivals , Hitachi , Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. , are n't sitting still .
19196	`` We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products . ''
19203	The losers will be those with the least attractive products , and many of them , analysts think , will be foreign companies .
19204	Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it plans to restructure in the wake of a third-quarter loss of $ 7.7 million , or $ 1.01 a share , reflecting an $ 11 million addition to loan-loss reserves .
19205	The Portland , Ore. , thrift said the restructuring should help it meet new capital standards from the Financial Institution Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act .
19206	A year ago , Benjamin Franklin had profit of $ 1.8 million , or 23 cents a share .
19208	The company said the restructuring 's initial phase will feature a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions .
19209	The plan may include selling branches , consolidating or eliminating departments , and winding down or disposing of unprofitable units within 18 months .
19210	Initially , the company said it will close its commercial real-estate lending division , and stop originating new leases at its commercial lease subsidiary .
19212	Amdahl Corp. , a maker of mainframe computers , reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter , citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong U.S. dollar .
19213	Net income fell 37 % to $ 32.9 million , or 30 cents a share , from $ 52.2 million , or 48 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
19216	Jay Stevens , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds , said he expected the Sunnyvale , Calif. , company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm 's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from International Business Machines Corp. , Amdahl 's principal competitor for mainframe sales .
19218	The Oneida , N.Y. , maker of consumer , food-service and industrial products also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share , with the same payable and record dates .
19220	The move rewards shareholders and should improve the stock 's liquidity , Oneida said .
19224	Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan , secretary of Health and Human Services .
19225	The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease .
19226	The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval .
19227	The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection .
19229	But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients .
19230	As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
19235	It should have happened sooner , '' said Elizabeth Glaser , a Los Angeles mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion , and transmitted it to two of her children .
19240	Her son , healthy and symptom-free , currently takes no medication .
19242	Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape .
19243	Secondly , critics have charged AZT 's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1 % of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market .
19244	Wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier for youngsters to take .
19245	Still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills .
19254	Mrs. Glaser , who is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation , based in Santa Monica , Calif. , condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot-dragging .
19256	`` The crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well , and to make sure other experimental drugs , like Bristol-Myers Co. 's DDI , do n't follow the same frustrating course as AZT . ''
19257	AIDS dementia -- which gradually steals children 's ability to speak , walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome .
19258	For some patients , AZT has restored the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily .
19259	`` It 's impossible to overstate how much this means to the families of these patients , '' said Samuel Broder , director of the National Cancer Institute and a main developer of AZT .
19265	Avon also said it will issue an additional 243,677 of the Class C warrants to holders of its Class A , Class B and unclassified warrants .
19268	The new `` baskets '' of stocks will allow big investors to buy or sell all 500 S&P index stocks in a single trade .
19271	Kemper Financial Services has stopped executing its stock trades through four big securities firms because of their involvement in program trading , which Kemper and others say is ruining the market .
19274	Bethlehem Steel 's profit plunged 54 % in the third quarter , hurt by higher costs and lower shipments to key clients .
19275	Also , Armco and National Intergroup had lower operating profit in steel , marking what may be the end of a two-year industry boom .
19276	Columbia S&L posted a quarterly loss of $ 226.3 million as the Beverly Hills thrift reeled from new industry rules and turmoil in junk bonds .
19279	Financial markets quieted , with stock prices edging lower , bonds inching up and the dollar almost unchanged .
19281	Fed Chairman Greenspan said the central bank can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but doing so will inflict short-term pain .

19301	Workers at six mines in Arctic Circle coal fields called strikes over a series of economic and political demands .
19304	The chamber voted 231-191 , 51 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the president 's veto of legislation renewing support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest .
19306	The legislation was part of a $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health .
19307	Michigan 's Senate passed a bill requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and Pennsylvania 's House cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy .

19313	In the San Francisco Bay area , more than 13,000 people were homeless and landslides threatened more houses .
19314	House-Senate conferees agreed to continue production of Grumman Corp. 's F-14 jet and to provide more than $ 3.8 billion during the current fiscal year to develop a space-based anti-missile system .
19317	The changes , which could be announced as early as today , would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods , officials said .
19319	The Communist Party chief , facing what is viewed as the nation 's worst unrest in nearly 40 years , also said he would allow East Germans to travel abroad more freely , but made clear that the Berlin Wall would remain .

19335	Marion Harper , 73 , founder and ex-chief executive of Interpublic Group of Cos. , in Oklahoma City , of a heart attack .
19339	A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
19341	`` Pete and Jeff and Joe Jr. have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work .
19343	Jeffrey , Peter and Joseph Jr. are brothers .
19345	Jeffrey , Peter , Joseph Jr. , William and Joseph Sr. constitute the company 's board .

19361	A spokeswoman said Toronto-based Campeau has received `` expressions of interest '' in Bloomingdale 's , but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made .
19362	Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's leading economic newspaper , reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department Store Co. is planning to team up with U.S. and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain , which Campeau has put up for sale .
19368	Among previously disclosed possible bidders is Bloomingdale 's Chairman Marvin Traub , who has aligned himself with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Blackstone Group .
19376	The sale of Bloomingdale 's is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to arrange $ 800 million in bridge financing for Campeau , which disclosed last month that its retailing units , Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. , were strapped for cash .
19377	O&Y , owned by Toronto 's Reichmann family , is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau , a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company .
19379	Separately , a Campeau shareholder filed suit , charging Campeau , Chairman Robert Campeau and other officers with violating securities law .

19397	Farmington , N.M.-based Mesa has consistently rejected StatesWest 's offers , and early this week said its board would n't give the proposal further consideration , calling it `` vague and ill-defined '' because it did n't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of StatesWest securities which were part of the offer .
19399	It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with StatesWest 's own cash and short-term investments , plus debt and other financing arranged through Hibbard Brown & Co. , the company 's investment banker .

19544	One day last March , CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank met for lunch at the Lotos Club here .
19548	Dick Pound , a committee member , began by disclosing that ABC and NBC had refused to even bid .
19550	Mr. Pilson and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes to return with a $ 300 million offer .
19553	Mr. Pilson 's rivals at ABC and NBC grimaced at the price .
19555	Well , CBS , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid .
19560	ABC , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts .
19567	At the same time , some sports events will move off `` free '' television and onto cable or pay-cable , where half the nation 's TV homes ca n't see them .
19569	Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over .
19571	Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do , they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up .
19574	CBS pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges Thomas H. Wyman , who was ousted as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9 % stake in the company and took over three years ago .
19575	`` They lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one .
19577	On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion .
19578	That 's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay .
19579	-LRB- After 1992 , the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996 . -RRB-
19580	Now , Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness .
19581	Next month , talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .
19584	A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise .
19586	J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . '
19591	`` I love Pilson , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' says Robert Wussler , a former CBS Sports president .
19595	A Yale law school graduate , he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at Metromedia Inc. and the William Morris talent agency .
19596	In 1976 , he joined CBS Sports to head business affairs and , five years later , became its president .
19597	Mr. Pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago , `` I did n't say forever , and I did n't say every property . ''
19599	And he is n't the only big spender : NBC will pay a record $ 401 million for the 1992 Summer Games , and ESPN , 80%-owned by Capital Cities\/ABC , will shell out $ 400 million for four years of baseball , airing 175 regular-season games a year .
19604	Mr. Pilson recalls that in April 1986 , after CBS 's annual meeting in Philadelphia , he and Mr. Tisch took the 90-minute train ride back to New York , and Mr. Pilson used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions .
19605	Mr. Tisch , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the TV business .
19606	Five months later , Mr. Tisch took over as CBS 's chief executive , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators .
19608	Mr. Pilson gave him one : He bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France ; ABC and NBC would n't bid even $ 200 million .
19612	He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs , grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later .
19613	Next October , CBS , for the first time , wo n't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series .
19615	Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC , '' he says .
19617	Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. Pilson says .
19618	But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30 % or 40 % larger than those CBS usually gets .
19619	Mr. Pilson says baseball and the Olympics may help CBS move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back into the network 's image .
19623	CBS will air the Super Bowl , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events .
19627	`` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' ESPN 's Mr. Werner says .
19629	During the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC touted `` Call to Glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks .
19636	In recent years , the World Series and the Olympics were aired against CBS 's last-place lineup .
19637	But CBS will put the athletes up against Bill Cosby , `` Cheers '' and other shows in NBC 's No. 1 schedule .
19650	CBS will pay an average of $ 82 million more each year than ABC and NBC had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season .
19651	Yet CBS will air only 12 regular-season games , 26 fewer than ABC and NBC .
19656	CBS signed General Motors and Toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years .
19662	CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating .
19664	It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers .
19665	CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events .
19672	`` This is n't outlandish bidding ; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it ... .
19675	That would cut into CBS 's slim margin for profit -- and error .
19677	And CBS takes in the least money in prime time ; ABC and NBC charge 30 % to 35 % more for ads , according to a Variety survey .
19678	But CBS 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that CBS locks up .
19682	Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $ 2.6 million to $ 2.8 million ; an hour-long drama costs only $ 900,000 , and it is aired twice .
19683	CBS may cushion losses with about $ 200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling CBS Records and other businesses .
19687	`` What you 're really asking is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says .
19691	Place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line .
19693	Or open up an electronics magazine and peruse the ads for sneaky tape recorders and other snooping gadgets .
19695	Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies .
19696	And while sellers of the equipment and companies `` monitoring '' employees have few qualms , right-to-privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed .
19697	`` New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work , '' says Janlori Goldman , a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union .
19699	On the corporate side , companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
19700	The practice is common at catalog , insurance and phone companies , banks and telemarketers , according to trade groups and worker organizations .
19701	It 's also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline , car-rental , hotel and railroad industries .
19703	Among companies saying they monitor employees are United Airlines , American Airlines , United Parcel Service , Nynex Corp. , Spiegel Inc. , and the circulation department of this newspaper .
19705	Dictaphone Corp. says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 .
19706	Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says John Hiltunen , Dictaphone 's manager of media relations .
19708	Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders .
19709	Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for about four years .
19710	Both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped .
19711	Kidder Peabody & Co. says it monitors bond-trading conversations between brokers and customers to safeguard order accuracy .
19713	But devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail .
19715	That and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands , but simple voice-activated tape recorders sell for as little as $ 70 at electronics stores like Radio Shack .
19718	Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it , lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue .
19719	Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring .
19720	And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded .
19725	In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping .
19727	The ACLU and worker organizations back tighter laws , but employers and device manufacturers object .
19731	Spiegel also opposes the beeper bill , saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors .
19733	`` We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. Dale , who supervises 350 operators .
19738	But opponents , led by the CWA , say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81 % of monitored workers are n't represented by unions .
19739	The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress .
19743	-LRB- Intercepting other people 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $ 10,000 . -RRB-
19745	Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including Communication Control System Ltd. , which owns the Counter Spy Shop and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the one-party law .
19749	He says he has n't yet studied the Dellums bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . ''
19752	With its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings , `` it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching , '' says Mr. Appel .
19756	Up to now , the intense competition between IBM and Digital has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market , where Digital sought to exploit IBM 's weaknesses in networking .
19761	IBM , which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes , also announced upgraded operating system software that , together with the new hardware , lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as 60 % faster .
19763	IBM said the 16 new J and JH models will generally be available immediately , though three wo n't ship until the third quarter of next year .
19779	In addition to commercial markets , Digital 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market , when it 's packaged with an optional supercharger , known as a vector processor .
19780	Digital 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay minicomputer line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the proprietary systems that older minicomputers use .
19786	But the 3090 line is nearly five years old -- which is getting up there in mainframe years -- and its growth is expected to slow in 1990 .
19790	IBM has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter , partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of IBM 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars .
19792	In addition to the new mainframe hardware and software , IBM announced a magnetic-tape system for data storage that it said occupies half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single cartridge .
19796	Concord is a camera and photographic products company .
19799	The White House called on Congress to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill , but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea .
19802	`` If that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater .
19803	On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill .
19804	Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said , `` I do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there .
19809	Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending .
19813	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications .
19814	Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 .
19818	To be introduced later are a multiplexer , which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line ; a light-wave system , which carries voice channels ; and a network controller , which directs data flow through cross-connect systems .
19820	Sonet , or synchronous optical network , products have more capacity than earlier models .
19822	He declined to disclose specific prices , but said each product costs in the tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of dollars .
19823	AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals , Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France 's Alcatel N.V. , which also have announced Sonet-based products .
19826	Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines .
19827	The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation 's largest law firms .
19829	Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour .
19830	If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do , `` you ca n't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish , '' says one lawyer at a large New York firm .
19831	`` We 're planning on a rip-roaring year in 1989 , but next year we 'll be another story , '' said Robert Freedman , a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett .
19833	Lawyers at such firms as Sullivan & Cromwell ; Willkie Farr & Gallagher ; Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz ; and Fried , Frank , Harris , Shriver & Jacobson all say they , too , have experienced a significant slowdown , particularly during the past few weeks .
19834	`` Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available , '' said Jack Nusbaum , co-chairman of Willkie Farr .
19835	`` It 's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical . ''
19838	What 's more , he said , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts .
19839	Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed .
19842	Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy .
19849	In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it .
19850	In March , Mr. Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy , mail and securities fraud , and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
19851	The government has charged that Mr. Lorin and Mr. Laff were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices .
19852	Mr. Lorin , a stock promoter , pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in April and agreed to cooperate with the government 's investigation of Mr. Laff .
19854	Stanley Aslanian , the Haas broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation , also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate .
19856	Mr. Lorin then repeated the threat , and Mr. Aslanian urged him not to say such things .
19858	When asked for a copy of the transcript , Mr. Lang said Judge Thomas P. Griesa had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum .
19866	Mr. Saltzburg , who teaches evidence at the University of Virginia School of Law and was a deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department until August , submitted his resignation earlier this month to federal Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. , in Richmond , Va .
19876	He previously was staff director and counsel for the Senate committee on banking , housing and urban affairs .
19878	THE PHILADELPHIA law firm of Ballard , Spahr , Andrews & Ingersoll said three partners have joined its business and finance department .
19880	Kent Walker , 45 , a former partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Mesirov , Gelman , Jaffe , Cramer & Jamieson , will specialize in antitrust , real estate and mergers and acquisitions .
19883	Delmed Inc. 's top two officers resigned and were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , a major Delmed holder that has been negotiating to acquire a controlling stake .
19884	In addition , Delmed , which makes and sells a dialysis solution used in treating kidney diseases , said negotiations about pricing had collapsed between it and a major distributor , National Medical Care Inc .
19885	Delmed said Robert S. Ehrlich resigned as chairman , president and chief executive .
19886	Mr. Ehrlich will continue as a director and a consultant .
19887	Leslie I. Shapiro , chief operating officer and chief financial officer , also resigned , the company said .
19889	Ben Lipps , president of Fresenius USA , was named president , chief executive and chief operating officer .
19893	The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock .
19894	The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed .
19898	While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued , Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990 , Delmed said .
19902	Kennametal is a carbide-products and cutting-tools company .
19903	J&L , whose principal offices are in Detroit , is a mail-order distributer of industrial tools and supplies .
19905	Genentech Inc. said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $ 11.4 million , or 13 cents a share , from a depressed 1988 third-quarter performance of $ 5.3 million , or six cents a share .
19909	But TPA sales fell below levels for this year 's first and second quarter sales of $ 48 million , cooling investors .
19911	In the nine months , net income slid 21 % to $ 28.4 million , or 33 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 42 cents a share .
19913	`` We continue to be on target for ... increasing TPA sales 20 % to 25 % this year , '' said founder and Chief Executive Officer Robert Swanson .
19916	Expenses are flat and that 's a good sign .
19917	There 's contract revenue from -LCB- limited research and development -RCB- partnerships .
19921	`` The company 's stock is trading at 40 times next year 's numbers , and that 's too much , '' she said .
19923	THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY 'S 1988 costs of fund raising and administration were $ 72.4 million , or 23.2 % of its revenue .
19925	Ryder System Inc. posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 27.6 million , because of an expected $ 57 million after-tax charge and continued weakness in the company 's truck-rental business .
19926	The loss , which is 38 cents a share , is the transportation services concern 's first quarterly setback in more than a decade and compares with net income of $ 55.3 million , or 68 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
19929	The latest quarter 's after-tax charge -- which is 75 cents a share -- was related to adjustments to reserves for workers ' compensation claims ; reductions in vehicle fleets , staff and facilities ; and writedowns of assets .
19930	Although Ryder did n't break out the charge , analysts estimated that the majority of the $ 57 million was linked to workers ' compensation reserves and anticipated losses on the disposal of trucks .
19934	M. Anthony Burns , Ryder 's chairman and chief executive officer , said : `` We 're constantly trying to find ways to regain the earnings momentum .
19936	He said the fourth quarter will be `` challenging , '' and maintained his conservative forecast that 1990 `` wo n't be a barn burner . ''
19937	In the nine months , net income fell 79 % to $ 31.1 million , or 33 cents a share , from $ 149.3 million , or $ 1.82 a share , a year earlier .
19939	Robert L. Wood , 37-year-old chief financial officer , was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent power producer , succeeding Raymond L. Hixson , 63 .
19943	The unit makes intravenous pumps used by hospitals and had more than $ 110 million in sales last year , according to Advanced Medical .
19944	Maxicare Health Plans Inc. , operating under Chapter 11 bankrupty-law protection , outlined terms of its reorganization plan that calls for creditors and shareholders to receive at least $ 78.8 million in cash and $ 67 million face amount of 10-year , 13.5 % notes .
19945	The plan , outlined in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , also calls for creditors and shareholders to receive common stock and warrants in the new company .
19946	The health-maintenance concern said it reached the agreement with its court-appointed creditors ' committees Sept. 28 , and intends to submit the plan to the bankruptcy court in November .
19948	The company has promptly paid all its expenses and obligations since March 16 , a Maxicare spokesman said .
19949	General unsecured creditors of Maxicare 's continuing operations initially will receive $ 47 million in cash , $ 35 million face amount of senior notes , and 49 % of the new company 's stock .
19950	Those creditors , whose claims are estimated at about $ 200 million , include doctors and hospitals .
19951	General unsecured creditors of Maxicare 's discontinued operations , whose claims total $ 110 million , initially will receive $ 17.8 million in cash and $ 10 million in senior notes .
19952	Maxicare 's public shareholders will receive 2 % of the new company 's stock and warrants entitling them to acquire as much as an additional 5 % of the stock on a fully-diluted basis .
19953	General unsecured creditors of the parent holding company initially will receive $ 14 million in cash , $ 22 million face amount of senior notes and 49 % of the new company 's stock .
19954	That group includes banks and bondholders , who have claims of $ 150 million and $ 350 million respectively .
19957	Those claims , along with priority employee claims , administrative claims , priority tax claims and administrative convenience claims , are expected to total about $ 16 million .
19958	The plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and others .
19961	Steelmaking resumed Oct. 18 , but the company expects production to be hampered in the next few months by traffic disruptions around the plant and outages for repair to gas and electric power systems .
19962	The average interest rate rose to 8.337 % at Citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , from 8.292 % at last week 's sale .
19971	Italian car manufacturer Fiat said it is n't interested in partnership or industrial cooperation with Swedish auto and aerospace group Saab-Scania AB , which faces heavy losses in its car division .
19973	`` We know that Saab is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation , '' Fiat said .
19975	The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division .
19976	Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer .
19977	News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault .
19981	Third-quarter net income dropped to $ 221 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 230 million , or $ 1.60 a share , in the year-earlier period .
19985	In addition to insurance and finance , ITT has interests in electronic parts , defense technology , automotive parts , fluid technology , pulp and timber , and communications and information services .
19986	`` Hurricane Hugo losses and the continuing industrywide downturn in the property and casualty insurance business were the major factors affecting quarterly comparisons , '' said Rand V. Araskog , chairman and chief executive officer .
19991	ITT also said its consumer finance unit agreed in September to settle a civil suit with the California attorney general over alleged improper lending and sales practices .
19995	Elaborating on the exception , it said volume and margins were lower in semiconductor and power systems operations .

20008	Coda Energy Inc. said it completed the sale of Phenix-Transmission Co. to Bishop Pipeline Co. , for $ 17 million in cash and notes .
20009	Coda , an oil and gas concern , said it and its partners received $ 7 million in cash and $ 10 million in five-year notes for the Kansas intrastate pipeline .
20010	Coda owned 60 % of the pipeline and private entities owned the rest .
20015	The institute did n't estimate annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 .
20016	The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .
20017	International Technology Corp. and Davy McKee Corp. , a unit of London 's Davy Corp. , said they were awarded a $ 55 million contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the closure of the Helen Kramer Landfill Superfund site in Mantua Township , N.J .

20025	It expects to begin construction by year end and start shipping four-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips by mid-1991 .
20026	U.S. Memories investors include Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , International Business Machines Corp. , Intel Corp. , LSI Logic Corp. , and National Semiconductor Corp .

20038	The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold .
20039	It 's one of the most popular computer programs of all time , but analysts said the Quickview suit does n't appear to bode major difficulties for Apple .
20042	In Cupertino , Calif. , Apple said that it believes the case has no merit , and that HyperCard does not infringe `` any valid claims '' of the Quickview patents .
20045	Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama 's comments , I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction : It is n't the Americans who must be criticized for not understanding the Japanese culture , but the Japanese who insist on forcing their culture on Americans .
20046	The Japanese want us to accept their culture , but they refuse to accept the American culture .
20050	Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas .
20056	While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences , both cultural and philosophic , I question his perspective .
20057	Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy ?
20059	Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand\/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating .
20060	The workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when management embraces the employees ' perspective .
20062	I believe Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others .
20071	When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism , I am convinced that Mr. Kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms .
20073	Cie . Generale des Eaux reported that net profit climbed 30 % in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25 % for the full year .
20076	Generale des Eaux said the earnings gain was led by its water , energy and building activities .
20084	Then , two weeks ago -- declaring that `` I 'm not looking for any conflict over this '' -- the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest .
20086	`` I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend .
20089	The result is mistrust and criticism from all around .
20100	The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it , experts insist .
20104	Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House .
20106	But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue , failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer 's Supreme Court decision to restrict those rights in the Webster case .
20110	`` My position is well-known and well-stated , '' he replied .
20113	Running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother .
20117	He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life .
20118	Throughout the early 1980s , Mr. Bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it .
20119	In April 1986 , then-Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape , incest and life endangerment , but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case .
20120	At the GOP convention last year , he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape , incest and life endangerment .
20124	When the ruling was handed down , the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself .
20125	He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund .
20130	Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape .
20134	When we look closely at our own history , it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people 's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments .
20136	And it is how African-Americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation .
20144	Ford Asia-Pacific will coordinate the activities of Ford subsidiaries in Japan , Australia , Taiwan and New Zealand and work with Ford business associates throughout the region .
20145	These functions are currently performed out of Melbourne , Australia , and at Ford 's headquarters in Dearborn , Mich .
20147	Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment , reported that third-quarter net income rose 11 % to $ 70.5 million , or $ 1.22 a share .
20148	In the year-ago period , Goodyear had net of $ 63.5 million , or $ 1.11 a share .
20152	He said results were better than he 'd expected and indicate that Goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year .
20154	Excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency translations , Mr. Millis said the company 's results `` were still a little disappointing . ''
20156	The Akron , Ohio-based company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about 31 % to $ 196.2 million from $ 150.2 million a year earlier , reflecting improvements in raw material costs , sales of replacement tires and pricing .
20157	McDonald 's Mr. Millis said Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988 .
20159	Total tire segment sales were up only about 1 % to $ 2.2 billion , and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers .
20162	For the nine months , profit skidded about 35 % , reflecting charges taken in this year 's second quarter and the effect of translations of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger U.S. dollar .
20163	Net was $ 192.1 million , or $ 3.33 a share , compared with net of $ 293.7 million , or $ 5.13 a share , the year earlier .
20164	The latest nine months included charges of $ 95 million related to the company 's South African subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit .
20166	Environmental Control Group Inc. said it expects to report `` minimal '' earnings or a loss for the third quarter .
20167	The environmental services company said that the discontinuation of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in baddebt reserves probably will result in charges of $ 2.5 million to $ 4 million , most of which will be taken against third-quarter results .
20168	In the year-ago quarter , the company reported earnings of $ 2.2 million , or 35 cents a share .
20171	Though imports were troublesome , they were n't running away with the market , and American companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years .
20173	He and Mr. Roderick were even dining out together .
20175	Mr. Icahn , the company 's deep-pocketed , tenacious adversary , recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1 % , and he again threatened a takeover .
20177	In addition , USX 's giant steel segment , representing 34 % of its 1988 sales , is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills .
20178	The import quotas got only a 2 1\/2-year extension , and USX is laboring under a staggering $ 5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil .
20182	Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn 's stock , possibly at a premium , or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn 's pressure .
20186	And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper .
20187	Over dinners at New York 's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants , the steel executive and the big investor talked steel , international trade and thoroughbred horses .
20192	He huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent .
20195	Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies ?
20198	And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets , by making it harder to arrange takeover financing , has eased some of the pressure on Mr. Corry , it does n't end the takeover threat .
20199	`` I know it 's not over , '' a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd. , USX 's partner in a steel mill in Lorain , Ohio .
20207	`` I do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry . ''
20212	Mr. Corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in Pittsburgh instead of New York or Findlay , Ohio , Marathon 's home .
20213	And , earlier this month , he announced the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil & Gas , which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since .
20214	One former executive says , `` Nobody wanted that deal inside USX except Dave Roderick , '' who was a hunting and fishing buddy of William L. Hutchison , chairman of Texas Oil & Gas .
20215	The executive recalls Mr. Corry whispering to him and others , `` Remember , this was Dave 's deal . ''
20216	What miffed many USX executives and shareholders was that the acquisition , for $ 3 billion of stock , doubled the USX shares outstanding and considerably diluted them .
20217	What 's more , the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as Texas Oil & Gas reported its first annual loss in 28 years .
20219	But when the two men met in New York a day after Mr. Icahn disclosed the rise in his USX stake , Mr. Corry learned that Mr. Icahn wanted him to sell all of Texas Oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline , gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations .
20220	That would leave USX with Marathon , its steel mills and its diversified business segment , which includes , among other things , mineral and transportation products .
20222	The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned .
20225	Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree .
20226	Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say .
20227	In the past five years , USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs .
20229	It is n't surprising that Messrs. Roderick and Corry view steel so differently .
20230	While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh 's smoking mills , Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati , a city nicknamed `` Porkapolis '' and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron .
20231	He has never met Lynn Williams , the president of the United Steelworkers union , and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group , the American Iron and Steel Institute , which Mr. Roderick served as chairman .
20232	`` Dave thought the country needed a strong U.S. Steel and , while Chuck agreed , he was more apt to say , ` Not at any cost to shareholders , ' '' a former executive says .
20233	Indeed , Mr. Corry , at an August press conference , talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and `` not a day longer . ''
20234	However , shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas : Having two major products would lessen the company 's vulnerability to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings .
20235	As Mr. Roderick once said : `` We 're a two-product company and , boy , if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts , you are so damn dumb that you do n't belong on Wall Street . ''
20237	`` The time has passed for us to spin off steel , '' either in a public offering or to a buyer , one executive contends .
20241	Marathon has benefited from higher crude-oil prices and strong demand for refined products .
20243	Indeed , when the Bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions -- arguably the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years -- Mr. Corry and his directors were aboard helicopters , high above Marathon 's rich oil reserves in the North Sea .
20249	And then , `` he wo n't panic , '' says J. Bruce Johnston , a former USX executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with Adler Cohen & Grigsby in Pittsburgh .
20253	`` What he really wanted to know was about a particular company , but you did n't know that .
20254	He wanted your own unbiased , virgin opinion , '' says Mr. Johnson , now managing director at Georgeson & Co. , a proxy-solicitation and investor-relations firm .
20256	`` It 's part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought , '' he said .
20262	Shaw-Walker , based in Muskegon , Mich. , makes metal files and desks , and seating and office systems furniture .
20263	Israel has launched a new effort to prove the Palestine Liberation Organization continues to practice terrorism , and thus to persuade the U.S. to break off talks with the group .
20270	Israel wants to end the dialogue , but our analysts take a different view than theirs . ''
20271	Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's top adviser on counterterrorism , Yigal Carmon , was here Monday to present the report to members of Congress , reporters and others .
20275	`` If the dialogue was based on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism , and we have evidence of continued terrorism , what would be the logical conclusion ? '' Mr. Carmon asked .
20276	Israel has long claimed Mr. Arafat never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against the Jewish state .
20277	Now , Jerusalem says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. Arafat .
20279	The new accusations come at a delicate time in U.S. efforts to bring about talks between Israel and Palestinian representatives .
20282	The U.S. defines it as `` premediated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents . ''
20283	To meet the U.S. criteria , Israel contended it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders .
20284	At the heart of Israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails .
20286	In addition , the officials say Israel has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by Fatah or by any group Mr. Arafat controls .
20292	Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions , and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow , when the preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product is released .
20293	But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants to bid the U.S. unit lower .
20295	By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down .
20296	When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday .
20297	Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day .
20300	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks , down from 1.8470 marks Monday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 141.90 yen late Monday .
20306	They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors .
20309	Traders attribute the mark 's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials .
20315	The news also knocked the British unit to below 2.95 marks in London , but a bout of short-covering helped sterling recoup some of its earlier losses .
20321	Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years .
20327	John Kriz , a Moody 's vice president , said Boston Safe Deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities .
20328	The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said .
20329	Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . ''
20330	As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he said .
20332	Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results .
20334	The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co. 's president and to the resignations of the company 's chief financial officer and treasurer .
20335	The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early , in an effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses .
20336	Mr. von Germeten , in turn , attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of conducting a `` witch hunt . ''
20340	The state petroleum monopoly said sales in the period gained 15 % , and $ 262.4 million more than originally projected at an average of $ 10 a barrel on an export platform of 1,250,000 barrels a day .
20343	Yesterday , the retailing and financial services giant reported a 16 % drop in third-quarter earnings to $ 257.5 million , or 75 cents a share , from a restated $ 305 million , or 80 cents a share , a year earlier .
20348	Under the new approach , Sears set prices that were somewhere between its old `` regular '' and `` sale '' prices .
20359	The company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores , and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items .
20360	Sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message .
20361	In a new TV ad , for instance , a woman going through the Sunday newspaper brands as hype claims by other stores that they are offering goods for `` 50 % , 60 % and 70 % off .
20365	Recent surveys by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates , a market research firm in Chicago , suggest that Sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise .
20370	`` The power of price as an appeal , which was very considerable in driving traffic in March and April , has diminished , '' says George Rosenbaum , president of Shapiro & Associates .
20371	`` You see some improvement in these other areas , but it 's a very small and slow process . ''
20373	Net income at Sears 's merchandise group , which includes international and credit card operations , as well as U.S. stores , fell 25 % .
20375	Sears said claims from the storm , as expected , reduced its third-quarter net by $ 80 million , or 23 cents a share .
20378	Net income at Sears 's Dean Witter Financials Services group , meanwhile , rose nearly 32 % to $ 35.7 million , reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and Discover credit card businesses .
20381	Oil imports to Japan rose 12 % in September from year-earlier levels , according to statistics released by the government 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry .
20383	The year-on-year rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products , and partly because of tax changes in 1988 that left oil companies with high inventories in the late-summer\/early-FALL PERIOD .
20384	Imports of crude from the Middle East grew 17 % from year-earlier levels , and Southeast Asian crude imports grew 43 % .
20394	1 -RRB- Foreclosed homes could be sold by the FHA for no down payment -LRB- the biggest obstacle to young buyers -RRB- , but with personal liability for the mortgage -LRB- no walking away by choice -RRB- .
20395	2 -RRB- Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one month 's payment -LRB- off the tail end of the mortgage -RRB- for every six months paid ; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage -LRB- balloon -RRB- , but `` forgiven '' on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant .
20397	An occupant will , in most every case , be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house .
20401	The Federal Housing Administration , Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` buying in '' to their foreclosed properties -LRB- of which there are , alas , many -RRB- at an inflated `` balance due '' -- say $ 80,000 on a house worth $ 55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it 's really worth .
20402	Worse , the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so , but are resold eventually -LRB- because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc . -RRB- to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again .
20404	Italy 's unemployment rate rose to 12 % of the labor force in July from 11.9 % in April , and was up from 11.7 % a year earlier , according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute .
20405	Istat said a national survey during the first week of July showed the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April , and from 2,853,000 a year ago .
20407	The southern unemployment rate rose to 21.3 % in July from 21.2 % in April and from 20.6 % a year earlier .
20410	Quarter net for the business-machines and financial-services company rose to $ 155 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 146 million , or $ 1.37 a share , in the year-earlier period .
20413	Sales growth and profit in business products and systems -- Xerox 's main business -- were `` disappointing , '' said B. Alex Henderson , who follows the company for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
20414	Sales of Xerox copiers and other office products grew 1.6 % ; `` we expected growth of 6 % to 7 % , '' Mr. Henderson said .
20417	`` They are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , '' he says .
20418	David T. Kearns , Xerox chairman and chief executive officer , cited the restructuring and `` strong '' cost controls for the 13 % growth in profit from business products and systems operations .
20419	Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding , though , in financial services because of rate pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains .
20420	In the quarter , the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations .
20421	The subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with Hurricane Hugo .
20422	For the nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 465 million , or $ 4.32 a share .
20425	Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department said .
20431	While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up .
20432	Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment .
20447	Now at least there are question marks about that , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed .
20451	In a statement , Arnold B. McKinnon , chairman and chief executive officer , noted that the new repurchase program `` should serve to enhance shareholder value . ''
20452	A spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand , borrowing and `` cash Norfolk expects to generate . ''
20453	Analysts said they expected the action , and investors applauded the move .
20458	In addition , Mrs. Lidgerwood said , Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income .
20462	`` At a certain price , if the management thinks -LCB- the stock -RCB- is cheap , they can go in and buy it . ''
20467	Last month , Mr. Curcio was succeeded by Ralph E. Reins as chief executive officer following several quarters of lackluster or declining performance .
20468	Falcon Holding Group Inc. said it agreed to acquire about 54,000 subscribers from First Carolina Cable TV Limited Partnership for about $ 100 million , or roughly $ 2,000 a subscriber .
20469	The subscribers are in 52 different communities in Georgia , Alabama and Mississippi .
20473	Richard W. Lock , retired vice president and treasurer of Owens-Illinois Inc. , was named a director of this transportation industry supplier , increasing its board to six members .
20475	RMI Titanium is owned jointly by USX and Quantum Chemical Corp .
20480	In the Manager 's Journal , Atsushi Kageyama , in commenting on many differences between American and Japanese culture , said , `` Japanese children are raised in a way many Americans would find severe .
20482	What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children , on the whole , are among the most undisciplined in the world , making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful .
20483	Unless parents and educators alike start to develop more discipline in children , all the worthy concern , discussions and actions will not solve the problem .
20485	Retired Adm. William J. Crowe , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Robert P. Luciano , chairman and chief executive officer of Schering-Plough Corp. , were elected directors of this securities firm .
20488	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
20519	Roy E. Parrott , the company 's president and chief operating officer since Sept. 1 , was named to its board .
20522	Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $ 800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations .
20525	The government built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways .
20527	It gave the Japanese people a value system , based on the rationalization that given the country 's lack of natural resources , they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus .
20531	The people have given their leading and only credible political party , the Liberal Democratic Party , clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years .
20533	But less than two years later , the LDP started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights .
20535	Its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120 million people in the back seat .
20536	In a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice .
20537	It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world .
20539	The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions .
20540	The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people .
20541	The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does not act on behalf of students .
20542	The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic .
20545	This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image .
20546	Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries .
20547	All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumers .
20548	They serve the industries and the special-interest groups .
20550	Japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks .
20558	This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .
20560	If you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % .
20564	They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change .
20565	All of a sudden , prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200 .
20566	They were 103 or 206 .
20569	Money , such as in Recruit 's political donations , and women , as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita , seldom have caused political scandals in Japan .
20570	Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals -LRB- though they were furious about Recruit -RRB- , women were upset about both and surged to the polls .
20571	In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections , in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory , 60 % of all women voted , as opposed to the usual 40 % .
20572	It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit , the sex scandals , or the one-yen coins in their purses , but they obviously were voting to punish the LDP .
20574	It 's now OK to deal with the U.S. , but not the Soviet Union .
20581	One party could stand for consumer interests , small government , free trade and globalism to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries .
20582	The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism .
20584	In the current mood of the Japanese people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins .
20585	We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets .
20591	Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes , searching for that unusual glint .
20593	Last year , 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats , which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat , or one-fifth gram .
20596	Here , wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world 's most inhospitable diamond dig , lies the earth 's most precious jewel box .
20597	Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa 's interior , then in the cold surf of the ocean , and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98 % of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality .
20600	Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908 , the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations .
20601	When the Germans lost World War I , they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer , patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers .
20602	Today , no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers 's stingy approval .
20606	Jackals roam the streets at night , and gemsbok , hardy antelope with long straight horns , wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers .
20607	On most days , the desert 's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag .
20609	Still , miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers 's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming .
20611	There are six video rental shops , three restaurants , one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling .
20617	Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters ; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator , with buckets instead of seats , chews through layers of compacted sand ; tracks and conveyor belts , shuttling sand to the screening plants , criss-cross the beach .
20618	Then there is the artifical sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , jutting into the ocean .
20622	Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood .
20626	Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators .
20627	Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds .
20634	None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security .
20635	DISASTER STATES are n't jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery .
20637	Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina , some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes .
20639	A spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs .
20641	A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says Hugo has n't prompted proposals for state or local increases .
20644	Legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although Gov. Deukmejian says they should be a last resort .
20645	Needs are n't clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult .
20649	As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges .
20650	If the IRS admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to IRS inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error .
20652	If the IRS asks for and gets a replacement for a check that it concedes it lost in processing , it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop-payment charge on the original .
20653	Reimbursement claims must be filed with the IRS district or service-center director within a year after the expense accrues .
20656	A couple we 'll call the Blandings spent nearly $ 800,000 on a 15-acre plot and main home and have an old $ 175,000 mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage-interest deductions .
20657	They plan to expand the home site by buying five adjoining acres for $ 200,000 , borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized by the 15 acres .
20658	Their debt will be well under the $ 1 million limit -- on borrowing to acquire , build , or improve a home -- that qualifies for mortgage-interest deductions .
20660	But , IRS private ruling 8940061 notes , no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence .
20661	So the IRS has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer ; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence .
20662	Thus , the IRS says , the Blandings ' $ 200,000 loan is home-acquisition debt , and interest on it is fully deductible .
20663	EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided for Hugo 's victims ; IRS Notice 89108 has details .
20664	Notice 89-107 offers added relief for hurricane-hit concerns that must file pension and benefit-plan returns .
20665	REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed by businesses , but do n't bet that contractors ' unreported income will be detected that way .
20668	A claim by Peter Testa of New York that a stranger paid him $ 500 to go into a bank and change $ 44,400 in small bills into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' the Tax Court found .
20671	A retired electrical engineer we 'll call Ben works part-time as a consultant , but he does n't want to earn so much that Social Security reduces his benefits .
20677	If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly .
20678	Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the IRS says ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them .
20680	Ways and Means veteran Gephardt -LRB- D. , Mo . -RRB- moves to the House Budget Committee ; Rep. Cardin -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- replaces him ... .
20681	Seattle 's license fees for adult peep shows vary from those for other coin-operated amusements without serving a substantial government interest and are unconstitutional , the ninth-circuit appeals court holds for Acorn Investments Inc .
20682	Blue-chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines they advertise in , ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad `` clutter '' and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines .
20683	Criticism from such big advertisers as Estee Lauder Inc. , Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Seagram Co. put a damper on the euphoria at the American Magazine Conference here .
20684	The conference opened Monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines ' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year .
20685	`` Magazines are not providing us in-depth information on circulation , '' said Edgar Bronfman Jr. , president and chief operating officer of Seagram , in a panel discussion .
20689	Reuben Mark , chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive , said advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines ' audiences .
20692	Leonard Lauder , president and chief executive officer of Estee Lauder , said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called `` niche-itis , '' the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers .
20696	He added : `` There 's probably even a magazine for left-handed golfers ... but the general interest magazine is something we all miss , and it should come back . ''
20697	Mr. Lauder also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of Elle , a fashion magazine published by Diamandis Communications Inc. , and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines .
20704	Wall Street securities giant Salomon Inc. posted a big , unexpected earnings gain in the third quarter , buoyed by its securities trading and investment banking activities .
20705	Salomon said net income soared to $ 177 million , or $ 1.28 a share , from $ 65 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .
20707	A Salomon spokesman said its stock , bond and foreign exchange trading , as well as its investment banking operations , were mostly responsible for the earnings jump .
20708	`` The earnings were fine and above expectations , '' said Michael W. Blumstein , an analyst at First Boston Corp .
20710	`` I suspect October was n't as good as the third quarter , and they 'll have difficulty matching the third quarter in the fourth quarter , '' Mr. Blumstein said .
20718	That 's the word expected to be on the lips of the more than 3,000 developers , pension-fund advisers and real estate financiers slated to attend a four-day conference , beginning here today , sponsored by the Urban Land Institute .
20719	The ULI is a non-profit research and education group based in Washington , D.C. , with 14,000 members nationwide .
20720	With the market overbuilt , builders are finding limited opportunities and increased risks .
20721	Developers and money managers are looking for bargains among the thousands of financially troubled properties around the country .
20722	Real estate professionals now often bill themselves as `` turnaround experts '' and `` workout specialists . ''
20723	Conference attendees are expected to be buzzing about the workings of the recently formed Resolution Trust Corp. , a federal agency charged with disposing of an estimated $ 200 billion of real estate dumped in government hands by insolvent savings and loans .
20730	Developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects .
20731	The builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market .
20732	`` Developers are teaming up with institutions often acting as project managers , '' says Smedes York , ULI president and president of York Properties Inc. , of Raleigh , N.C .
20735	`` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists , the neighborhood groups , dealing with traffic mitigation , sewers and fighting city hall , then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ? '' says Jack Rodman , managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm .
20737	The level of interest in the RTC 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated , says Stan Ross , Leventhal 's co-managing partner .
20738	And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time .
20739	Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
20741	Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two `` world-class '' hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow .
20742	U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations .
20743	`` This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress , '' said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin , who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture 's partners at the Soviet embassy here .
20747	One of the hotels , to be called the Sheraton Moscow , will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $ 75 million to build .
20748	The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers .
20749	It will have a Russian tavern , an English pub , a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants , according to a Sheraton announcement .
20752	Details about its size and cost have n't yet been determined .
20754	The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet , Moscow 's city governing body , and Aeroflot , the Soviet national airline .
20758	Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures .
20759	Sheraton and Pan Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .
20760	The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $ 140 to $ 150 a day for each of its rooms , and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets , according to a Sheraton executive .
20764	Mr. Shaffer takes primary responsibility for the electronic and technical-services group .
20766	Also , Sheldon Aboff , formerly a vice president at Maxwell , was named group vice president with responsibility for various electronic and publishing-group companies .
20767	Soichiro Honda 's picture now hangs with Henry Ford 's in the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame , and the game-show `` Jeopardy '' is soon to be Sony-owned .
20768	But no matter how much Japan gets under our skin , we 'll still have mom and apple pie .
20777	It has more sugar `` than any apple we 've ever tested , '' says Duane Greene , a University of Massachusetts pomologist , or apple scholar .
20778	It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the public , '' says Grady Auvil , an Orondo , Wash. , grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them .
20780	Mr. Auvil , razor sharp at 83 , has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years .
20786	New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom .
20792	`` Red Delicious has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' says Washington State 's Mr. Norton .
20793	The scare over Alar , a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made consumers shy away from the Delicious , though they were less affected than the McIntosh .
20794	The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to growers .
20800	Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs .
20801	Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer .
20804	`` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently .
20807	He bites it , scowls and throws it down . ``
20811	But freshness counts more than it once did , and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apples .
20812	`` Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious , maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis , '' says Chuck Tryon , perishables director for Super Valu Inc. , a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor .
20814	Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis to hone its color , taste and shelf life .
20817	`` The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality , '' says David Lane , a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland , British Columbia , and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity .
20828	`` When the chain stores took over , there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer .
20831	Then , as growers bred them more for looks , and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long-term storage , the Red went into decline .
20832	Now , those red applelike things stores sell in summer are fruitbowl lovely , but usually not good eating .
20835	It ripens later than most apples , and growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky .
20837	Mr. Broderick , the Massachusetts grower , says the `` big boss '' at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine .
20840	He sees a shift in American values -- at least regarding apples -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz .
20847	The firms are Morgan Stanley & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , County Natwest Government Securities Inc. , Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and Goldman , Sachs & Co .
20852	The pool invested idle cash for many state agencies and local governments .
20855	From 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficits totaled $ 1.41 trillion , the government issued $ 394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantees .
20856	These figures omit secondary guarantees , deposit insurance , and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises -LRB- a huge concern in its own right , as detailed on this page May 3 -RRB- .
20857	Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially .
20858	Since the 1950s , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and policy applications , spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular .
20861	Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement .
20864	Last month , the General Accounting Office reported that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated , and that FHA 's equity fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .
20865	GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs .
20866	Scores of other credit programs , subsidizing agriculture , small business , exporters , defense , energy , transportation and others , are less visible but in no better shape .
20867	If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering : The federal government holds $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees .
20868	-LRB- Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion . -RRB-
20869	Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs .
20871	There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program .
20873	Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time .
20878	However , this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans .
20879	Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy .
20880	For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral .
20882	High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high .
20883	Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates .
20884	In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates .
20885	While the student was in school , interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance .
20886	This program , combined with cash grants to needy students , would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries .
20891	But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing defaults .
20892	For example , the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders ' Program .
20896	Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection -LRB- taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies -RRB- and to deny new credit to defaulters .
20897	These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections .
20901	By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit .
20904	This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses , or determined by selling loans to private owners -LRB- without federal guarantees -RRB- .
20905	Neither technique is perfect , but both are better than the current system , which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ 20 billion annually , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
20906	A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to .
20907	4 . Impose standard accounting and administrative practices .
20909	Many agencies roll over their debt , paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans .
20914	The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices , including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits .
20915	Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises , provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions , and reduce fraud .
20916	Government lending was not intended to be a way to obfuscate spending figures , hide fraudulent activity , or provide large subsidies .
20917	The reforms described above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender .
20920	Malcolm S. Todt was named vice president and senior officer in charge of equipment leasing to municipalities , a new effort of this bond insurer .
20921	Mr. Todt had been vice president and treasurer of Insilco Corp .
20923	Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto , which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill .
20925	But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto .
20929	Harris Ravine , executive vice president of customer satisfaction , was named executive vice president , finance and administration of this maker of data storage equipment .
20930	Mr. Ravine succeeds William R. Mansfield Jr. , who will remain with the company until the end of the year to support the transition and to complete important projects .
20932	The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products .
20933	But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved .
20936	Mr. Yeutter , seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000 , said the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . ''
20937	The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva , hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990 .
20938	Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more `` fair play '' in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies .
20940	For instance , the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition .
20943	Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would be allowed to continue under certain conditions .
20944	The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily .
20948	Procter & Gamble Co. , helped by a gain from a lawsuit settlement and continued growth overseas , posted a 38 % rise in fiscal first-quarter net income .
20949	Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 climbed to $ 551 million , or $ 1.66 a share , from $ 400 million , or $ 1.18 a share , a year earlier .
20952	Earnings at the consumer-products giant were boosted by a gain of $ 125 million , or about 25 cents a share , stemming from last month 's settlement of litigation with three of P&G 's competitors over patents on P&G 's Duncan Hines cookies .
20954	Wall Street had expected a modest rise in the company 's domestic sales and earnings , and more substantial increases in overseas results .
20955	One factor helping sales and earnings was a 3 % price rise for most P&G products , except coffee , analysts said .
20956	Unit volume , or amount of products shipped , rose about 11 % in the international segment , with P&G continuing to win market share in Japan 's diaper and detergent markets .
20959	P&G 's U.S. shipments were up just 1 % , partly because the company decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to the fiscal second quarter .
20962	Last year 's drought in the Midwest prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases , boosting sales for Crisco and Puritan oils , analysts said .
20963	For fiscal 1990 , analysts expect P&G 's sales to continue to grow , with earnings climbing between 15 % and 20 % .
20967	One big factor affecting the fiscal second half will be the new stewardship of Edwin L. Artzt , who becomes chairman and chief executive officer in January .
20969	`` If he does to the domestic operations what he did internationally , '' says Mr. Zurkuhlen , `` this company will earn $ 6 or $ 7 a share in a few years .
20970	The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks to go to the polls , unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices .
20971	Twenty-five years later , the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities -- Hispanics , Asians and native Americans -- holding elective office .
20972	In the 1980s , the Justice Department and lower federal courts that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of `` safe '' minority election districts -- districts where minorities form between 65 % and 80 % of the voting population .
20974	Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible .
20978	As is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders .
20981	Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , Hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important trait .
20982	Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one .
20983	Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities -- New York and Birmingham , Ala .
20984	When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue .
20987	In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts .
20990	The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts .
20991	Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38 % of the city 's population and hold only 25 % of the seats on the council .
20992	Several of the city 's black leaders , including Democratic mayoral nominee David Dinkins , have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and Hispanics `` the fullest opportunity for representation . ''
20993	In this connection , it is important to note that several members of New York 's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black , Hispanic , and non-Hispanic white populations -- Carolyn Maloney 's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter 's 25th district in Brooklyn , for example .
20994	To win their seats on the council , these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all .
20995	Often they have found that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education .
20999	Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts , including four safe white districts .
21000	The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented , because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to `` black interests '' could win .
21001	No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority , but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts .
21003	`` In the past , people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said .
21004	`` Now you go to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . ''
21005	Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
21006	A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman , they said .
21008	Madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good .
21009	Large , heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government , said Madison , because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none .
21010	Madison 's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us .
21011	As long as we believe that all Americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interests and can live together cooperatively , our political map should reflect our belief .
21012	Racial gerrymandering -- creating separate black and white districts -- says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people .
21016	Under -LCB- RICO -RCB- , the government may seek a temporary restraining order -LRB- TRO -RRB- upon the filing of a RICO indictment , in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered .
21017	Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants , including clients , vendors , banks , investors , creditors , dependents , and others .
21021	1 . As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions , the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section .
21023	2 . In seeking approval of a TRO , the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties , balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets .
21024	3 . In deciding whether forfeiture -LRB- and , hence , a TRO -RRB- is appropriate , the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense ; the government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime .
21025	4 . When a RICO TRO is being sought , the prosecutor is required , at the earliest appropriate time , to state publicly that the government 's request for a TRO , and eventual forfeiture , is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is , in requesting the TRO , the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant ; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them ; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties ; and will , in all other respects , assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected , through proceeding under -LCB- RICO -RCB- and otherwise .
21026	The Division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or , at the latest , at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO .
21027	Sales of North American-built cars and trucks plunged 20.5 % in mid-October from a year earlier , as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year .
21029	This trend appears to be especially true at General Motors Corp. , which used both dealer and consumer incentives to ignite sales in August and September .
21034	The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
21036	The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans 10.4 % below year-ago levels , but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve .
21038	Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2 % drop in sales of domestic-made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2 % drop in domestic trucks to 31,143 .
21041	Town & Country Ford in Charlotte , N.C. , still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks .
21042	Business had been fairly strong until Hurricane Hugo hit the area , but has been down since .
21044	The No. 3 U.S. auto maker had a 23.7 % plunge in car sales to 22,336 and a 17.5 % drop in truck sales to 22,925 , which include its minivans and Jeeps .
21046	But sales of domestic cars and trucks at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 26.1 % to 5,651 .
21047	A Nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales .
21052	x - There were 9 selling days in the most recent period and 9 a year earlier .
21055	The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13 , the day the Nasdaq composite index slid 3 % and the New York Stock Exchange tumbled 7 % .
21058	However , the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed , or settled , by Oct. 13 , rather than trades that occurred on that day , according to Gene Finn , chief economist for the NASD .
21059	Generally , it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade .
21060	The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 .
21061	The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2 % decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3 % rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period .
21062	Generally , a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later ; the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold .
21063	Short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks .
21065	Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive , Intel , Campeau and LIN Broadcasting .
21068	Intel makes semiconductors and Campeau operates department-store chains and is strained for cash .
21071	First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line .
21075	For example , an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other .
21077	Short interest in the American depositary receipts of Jaguar , the target of both Ford Motor and General Motors , more than doubled .
21078	Nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included Adobe Systems , Class A shares of Tele-Communications and takeover targets Lyphomed and Jerrico .
21079	The NASD , which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade , compiles short interest data in two categories : the approximately two-thirds , and generally biggest , Nasdaq stocks that trade on the National Market System ; and the one-third , and generally smaller , Nasdaq stocks that are n't a part of the system .
21083	The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 -LRB- see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 -RRB- .
21086	The weight of Lebanon 's history was also against him ; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating .
21087	Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration .
21092	Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor , says its present prime minister , redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland .
21093	By not choosing one of these options , Israelis will condemn themselves , as the Maronites did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state .
21096	The Nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed down 1.2 % .
21097	The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers , who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally .
21098	After plummeting 1.8 % at one point during the day , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down 5.52 , at 461.70 .
21099	In contrast , the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1 % .
21102	Microsoft , battered by profit taking in recent sessions , sank as much as 4 ; but it finished at 80 7\/8 , down 2 1\/4 on volume of one million shares .
21106	Apple Computer improved 7\/8 to 47 5\/8 ; Intel slipped 1\/4 to 33 1\/4 , and Valley National Corp. was up 1\/8 to 15 1\/8 .
21107	`` The market started with several strikes against it , '' said Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating .
21109	Even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board . ''
21110	Mr. DaPuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors .
21111	While Shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account , the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged .
21115	That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will .
21119	The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading .
21128	The company said losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California have n't yet been determined , but that it provides earthquake coverage to about 1,400 properties in the stricken area .
21133	The company said the latest quarter included about $ 3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to McCaw Cellular Communications ' bid for the company and LIN 's merger pact with BellSouth .
21136	IBM is reviewing its entire business-partners program , and XL\/Datacomp confirmed earlier this month that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current IBM-remarketer contract .
21137	Remarketers make modifications to IBM 's computer hardware and resell the products .
21142	-- `` Whether the installation is for early warning or space track , it clearly is not deployed , '' the lawmakers said .
21144	The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times , aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin , and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members .
21146	-- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness , by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow , so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union .
21153	As it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem .
21158	The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there , and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention .
21160	It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February : An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths .
21163	And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk , we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year .
21167	And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it .
21168	Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself .
21170	Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government .
21171	But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling .
21172	The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or , alternatively , that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident .
21174	Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $ 500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding .
21177	Manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made .
21182	Based on Manville 's closing price yesterday of $ 9.25 a share , Manville 's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares , or about 75 % of the trust 's preferred stock holding .
21183	In addition to the stock and 20 % of Manville 's profits beginning in 1992 , the trust is supposed to receive $ 2.5 billion over its 27-year life .
21184	But it initially was funded with about $ 765 million and may soon face a cash crunch .
21185	As of June 30 , it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ 136 million , a large portion of its $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
21186	Since most of its assets are tied to Manville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to diversify its holdings .
21187	As part of its offer , Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure . ''
21190	Manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold , as needed , and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares .
21195	A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .
21196	Under the new Northeast Utilities plan , it would pay $ 1.65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $ 100 million in pollution control bonds .
21197	Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January
21199	Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds .
21202	Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies .
21206	That plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a 41 % stake and give common shareholders as little as 13 % .
21209	The other bidder is United Illuminating Co. , New Haven , Conn. , with a bid valued at $ 2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5 % rate increases .
21211	Tons of delectably rotting potatoes , barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state 's buyers away .
21212	Many a piglet wo n't be born as a result , and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop .
21215	Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system , even Solidarity 's sympathetic new government wo n't win him over .
21216	In coming months , emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity .
21218	In June , farmers held onto meat , milk and grain , waiting for July 's usual state-directed price rises .
21220	The farmers ran a boycott , and meat disappeared from the shops .
21221	On Aug. 1 , the state tore up its controls , and food prices leaped .
21223	That was when the tame old Peasants ' Party , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc 's first liberated government .
21229	At dawn on a cool day , hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin , a town not far from Warsaw , hauling pigs , cattle and sacks of feed that the state 's official buyers ca n't induce them to sell .
21231	In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field , Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching , overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher 's Polish Fiat .
21235	He wo n't for long , because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up .
21241	Like the others , it is loaded with rye , wheat and oats in sacks labeled `` Asbestos . Made in U.S.S.R . ''
21246	A heavy , kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers , and counts him out a pile of zlotys .
21258	State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them .
21259	Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed .
21261	Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started .
21264	`` There are a lot of them , and they have property . ''
21268	As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning , family farms thrive where collectives fail .
21272	On it , a quarter of the country 's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain , beef , eggs and milk , and nine-tenths of its fruit , vegetables and potatoes .
21274	Try as they might , the Communists could neither replace nor break him .
21276	A few miles past Radzymin , a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice , a village of tumbledown farms .
21278	He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens , five cows and 25 piglets .
21279	In patched pants and torn shoes , he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic .
21286	Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows .
21288	In his lifetime , 47 years , the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir .
21292	`` They started , and then abandoned it . ''
21312	Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines .
21313	When supplies are short , it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain .
21314	A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land , hire help , decide what to grow and how to grow it .
21315	He is free to invest in chickens , and to fail for lack of chicken wire .
21316	He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices .
21321	Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors .
21324	Some men stay , their best friend a bottle of vodka , but two million acres have gone fallow .
21330	Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland , the pickles and sauerkraut sublime , the state monopolies long broken .
21331	Grain , milk and meat come next .
21332	A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast .
21341	`` I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees , '' he says .
21343	`` I hire transportation , and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day .
21351	He has bought some trendy Western clothes , and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window .
21359	Both the Peasants and Rural Solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers .
21367	`` Many people in Poland hope this government will break down , '' says Mr. Niciporuk , who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity .
21397	The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake .
21398	The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law .
21399	By a lopsided 401-18 margin , the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters , and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $ 1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress .
21400	The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991 , and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta , whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week .
21405	The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for low-interest disaster loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
21410	The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance .
21414	For example , disaster loans , which will go to small businesses and homeowners , offer credit as low as 4 % in some cases .
21415	But the San Francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $ 500,000 from $ 100,000 to assist the hard hit but often wealthy Marina district .
21416	The Senate is expected to make some modifications today , but both the White House and Congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight 's deadline .
21417	Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding , and the Senate changes are expected to be largely technical -- dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total Small Business Administration loans to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the increased activity expected .
21418	Yesterday 's floor action came as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $ 8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill , representing a 5 % reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad .
21420	But all funding is cut for the Philippines , and projects in South Korea are cut to $ 13.6 million , or less than a sixth of the administration 's request .
21423	And $ 70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat , Sen. James Sasser .
21424	Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference , but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska , Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process .
21430	Mr. Inouye , who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs , used his power to move $ 400,000 from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center .
21431	Meanwhile , House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $ 3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative , cutting other federal spending 0.43 % to pay for it .
21434	The size of the cuts is n't known , but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division , which is responsible for locating oil reserves , drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas .
21436	Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver .
21437	This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil , which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15 % to 20 % during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout .
21439	In yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report , the company alluded to a $ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations .
21440	The report says that `` the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations . ''
21442	Most oil companies , including Mobil , have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses .
21444	Yesterday , Mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third quarter , while comparable foreign operations earned $ 234 million .
21454	They strongly suggest that Justice 's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert , Michael Milken and Princeton\/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness .
21456	This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani , who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets .
21457	The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors , clients , bankers and others .
21460	It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are `` less intrusive '' alternatives , such as bonds , and in any case not to seek forfeitures `` disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
21463	Princeton\/Newport investors , including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment , made the rational decision to withdraw their money ; for the firm , the liquidation was sentence first , verdict later .
21465	The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank .
21471	But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors .
21473	He said ours is supposed to be `` a government of laws not of men , '' and yet RICO defenders `` tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO . ''
21474	No prosecutorial guidelines , observed or unobserved , limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages .
21475	What now for Princeton\/Newport officials , Drexel and Mr. Milken ?
21479	Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season .
21481	`` Teddy Z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp .
21482	It was promoted on cable services , including MTV , Nick at Night and VH-1 , and premiered as the No. 22-rated show for the week .
21485	Worse , every week it suffers audience drop-off from `` Murphy Brown '' and viewership on CBS picks up again once `` Teddy Z '' is over and is followed by `` Designing Women . ''
21487	Last week , `` Murphy Brown '' was viewed by 14.1 % of the available television households , while the number dropped to 12.6 % for `` Teddy Z '' and rose to 14.2 % for `` Designing Women . ''
21489	Creator Hugh Wilson , for example , included the lead character 's Greek family in the cast , `` but that is not the right focus anymore , '' said one CBS executive .
21490	Instead , CBS hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent .
21492	`` But we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family . ''
21495	The stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors .
21497	But the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies .
21501	At its strongest , the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point , or more than $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
21503	But analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market .
21504	A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices .
21506	But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August .
21508	Taken together , the auto-sales and durable-goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down .
21510	Now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's October employment report as potentially prompting the Fed to lower rates .
21513	Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens , the dollar ended down only modestly .
21515	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained nearly half a point , or about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
21518	In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen , compared with 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen Monday .
21519	`` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous '' may be visiting some new venues in the near future .
21522	Mr. Bakker said he was guilty of sin but not fraud .
21525	The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France .
21526	Currently , Boeing has a backlog of about $ 80 billion , but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists , which entered its 22nd day today .
21527	Last week , a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers , who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10 % over three years .
21528	When the good fairy assigned to Slovakia hovered over the cradle of Edita Gruberova many years ago in Bratislava , she sprinkled her with high E flats , sparkling Ds , clean trills , and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust .
21529	Maybe she could drop by at the Metropolitan Opera and bring along what she forgot , a little charm , a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig .
21530	Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi 's `` La Traviata , '' Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well .
21531	It is n't every day that we hear a Violetta who can sing the first act 's high-flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly stitched together .
21532	Never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow .
21536	She has TB , after all , and a weak-kneed lover ; and though a successful courtesan , she is just about overdrawn at the bank .
21542	But this is a production designed and directed by Franco Zeffirelli and paid for by Sybil Harrington , who has no need to count her pennies , unlike Violetta , down to 20 louis at the opera 's end .
21544	Large and lavish , `` Traviata '' is another addition to the Met 's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. Zeffirelli .
21545	They have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast is n't up to either .
21546	If a strike ever hits the Met , the company can still sell tickets to his `` Boheme '' and `` Turandot '' and boom out recordings -LRB- of another era -RRB- .
21553	This is the same production already seen in Paris and Florence , and its scenic ideas echo the movie he made with Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas .
21558	Once she did so , the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid , flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging .
21559	Of heart-pounding moments there were nearly none , and whether this has to do with Mr. Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say .
21562	Perhaps Mr. Kleiber could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from Mahler 's `` Kindertotenlieder . ''
21563	Speaking of dark nights , the Met 's next-door neighbor , the New York City Opera , has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians , who wanted pay parity with the the Chicago Lyric and San Francisco Opera orchestras .
21564	Well , they can now go and audition there .
21567	The cancellation bodes poorly for a company already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general director Beverly Sills and the amazing appointment of Christopher Keene as her successor after his years of feckless toiling in the pit .
21571	For all that , the piece landed unperformed in a dusty archive after Bologna refused to supply a chorus and orchestra .
21575	Also , Teodulo Mabellini 's `` Lux aeterna '' was intriguingly scored and splendidly put across by Mr. Rilling .
21576	He brought along his Stuttgart-based Gaechinger Kantorei chorus , and even better , the Czech soprano Gabriela Benackova .
21578	Maybe she could step across the plaza to the Met -- where she has still to make her debut -- and help out her Czech compatriot by singing the slow parts of `` Traviata . ''
21579	The Tokyo International Film Festival was no match for the Cannes Film Festival in terms of prestige , but it made its mark : It awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first-time film makers .
21584	Vincent Tolentino , a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama , says of the recently ended Tokyo festival : `` No one makes deals ... and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals . ''
21585	Belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy shares or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs -LRB- about $ 2.60 -RRB- for each transaction , bringing the total fee to 200 francs .
21587	The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks , who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors .
21588	Japan is considering giving aid to Hungary and Poland to support their recent political reforms , a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said .
21590	He said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to Western Europe next January .
21591	Drugs were a major issue in two days of talks between French President Francois Mitterrand and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez .
21594	The leaders ' talks coincided with a meeting in Madrid of anti-drug experts from the U.S. , France , Italy , Spain , Peru , Bolivia and Colombia .
21595	That conference , which began yesterday , was expected to cover such matters as police training and extradition agreements , Spanish officials said .
21596	Three Soviet government officials -- the ministers of railroads , of foreign economic relations and of heavy-machine building -- will visit Tehran next month for talks , Iran 's official news agency reported .
21597	Under an agreement signed last June , the Soviets will help Iran in oil exploration and other areas in return for exports of Iranian natural gas .
21600	A Toto spokesman said the toilet not only tests blood pressure , pulse and urine , it also stores the data for up to 130 days .
21601	Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. and Omron Tateisi Electronics are involved with Toto 's new product , which will go on the market in about two years time .
21605	Hector Castaneda Jimenez , chief prosecutor at the Attorney General 's Office , said that an estimated $ 82.8 million in government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the campaign to root out official corruption .
21609	`` The rest will probably not be recoverable either because the statute of limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail rather than return the money , '' the prosecutor said .
21615	Cray jolted the market in July when it slashed revenue and earnings projections for this year , citing a slowing economy that has delayed orders from government as well as commercial customers .
21617	Cray said it earned $ 30.6 million , or $ 1.04 a share , up 35 % from $ 22.6 million , or 73 cents a share , a year ago .
21619	For the nine months , earnings totaled $ 36.6 million , or $ 1.24 a share , down 46 % from $ 68.1 million , or $ 2.19 a share , a year earlier .
21624	Marcello Gumucio , president , said the company `` did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned , and not quite as well in terms of signing orders . ''
21625	As for the current period , Mr. Gumucio said , `` We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters , but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter '' when Cray earned $ 88.5 million , or $ 2.80 a share .
21628	Last year , Cray earned $ 156.6 million , or $ 4.99 a share , on revenue of $ 756.3 million .
21630	Noting that Cray does n't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of Convex Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , Mr. Luber said such a machine would be necessary `` to get things back on line here . ''
21632	Johnson & Johnson reported a 10 % rise in third-quarter net income on a 12 % sales increase - results that were driven particularly by new products including pharmaceuticals and the company 's professional operations .
21633	Net for the New Brunswick , N.J. , maker of health-care products climbed to $ 265 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 240 million , or 71 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
21636	In a statement , Ralph S. Larsen , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company was pleased with its third-quarter sales performance , `` especially in light of the extremely competitive environment in domestic consumer markets and the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates this quarter . ''
21639	Mr. Larsen noted `` substantial sales growth '' for the recently introduced Acuvue disposable contact lens and Hismanal , a once-a-day antihistamine .
21640	Eprex , used by dialysis patients who are anemic , and Prepulsid , a gastro-intestinal drug , did well overseas , he said .
21641	Despite health-care cost controls and programs to hold down inventory , the professional division , which makes products including sutures and surgical stapling equipment , `` achieved solid growth , '' Johnson & Johnson said .
21643	The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category , `` as well as the intense competition in the company 's sanitary protection product line . ''
21650	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
21653	Laserscope , initial offering of 1,656,870 common shares , of which 1,455,000 shares are to be sold by the company and 201,870 by holders , via Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. and Volpe , Covington & Welty .
21655	Western Gas System Inc. , initial offering of 3,250,000 common shares , of which 3,040,000 shares will be sold by the company and 210,000 by a holder , via Prudential-Bache Capital Funding , Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. and Hanifen , Imhoff Inc .
21657	Six top executives at the New York-based company sold shares in August and September .
21660	Much of the recent slide in Dun & Bradstreet 's stock came late last week , after negative comments by analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman , Sachs & Co .
21661	A company spokesman declined to comment and said that the officials who sold shares would n't comment .
21663	It also owns Moody 's Investors Service , which assigns credit-ratings to bonds and preferred stock ; A.C. Nielsen , known for its data on television-viewing patterns , and Yellow-pages publisher Donnelley .
21665	In June , the company agreed to settle for $ 18 million several lawsuits related to its sales practices , without admitting or denying the charges .
21668	He received $ 724,579 for the shares , according to insider filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
21669	John C. Holt , an executive vice president and Dun & Bradstreet director , sold 10,000 shares on Aug. 31 for $ 588,800 , filings show .
21671	William H.J. Buchanan , the firm 's secretary and associate general counsel , sold 7,000 shares in two separate sales in September for $ 406,000 .
21673	The other insiders , all senior or executive vice presidents , sold between 2,520 and 6,881 shares , representing between 8 % and 70 % of their holdings , according to SEC filings .
21678	He cut his rating to a short-term hold from above-average performer and reduced his 1990 earnings estimate .
21683	Insider selling is not unusual at Dun & Bradstreet ; in fact , the recent pace of selling is just about average for the company , according to figures compiled by Invest\/Net , a North Miami , Fla. , firm that specializes in tracking and analyzing SEC insider filings .
21684	But previous sales have often been sales of shares purchased through the exercise of stock options and sold six months later , as soon as allowed , said Robert Gabele , president of Invest\/Net .
21697	Peter Kutney sold 5,000 shares , all of his holdings , for $ 11.38 a share , or $ 56,900 .
21700	On Wall Street , Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Daniel A. Roling rates the stock `` neutral '' and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. lists it as a `` buy . ''
21702	`` It 's a good company , and growing ; there 's nothing that would warrant that it be sold . ''
21704	Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all .
21708	If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life , then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason , self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene .
21711	Star lecturer at Harvard , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby , Mr. Gould is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary theorist .
21714	In `` Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History '' -LRB- Norton , 326 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , Mr. Gould makes his case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution . ''
21718	The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species .
21720	It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale .
21721	By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures , this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet .
21724	A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text .
21728	The vast majority of them , however , were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate .
21736	Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating ; like an existentialist of old , he views our contingency as `` a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility . ''
21737	I , by contrast , can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead , beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion .
21738	But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all , the universe is a big place , and given the right conditions , sympathetic to creating some form of life .
21742	The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week .
21744	But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . ''
21745	Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
21746	Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains .
21747	In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . ''
21756	The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo .
21758	A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
21761	California 's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency .
21762	Both Mr. Brown , the state 's most influential legislator , and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government .
21764	Mr. Brown , meanwhile , believes `` only one tax will be feasible , and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase , '' said Chuck Dalldorf , an aide .
21766	The fund has about $ 1 billion and is set up to handle `` precisely the kind of emergency '' the state faces , said Tom Beermann , the Governor 's deputy press secretary .
21773	`` If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said Kirk West , president of the California Chamber of Commerce .
21777	But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis .
21781	`` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said Quentin Kopp , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee .
21783	The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct .
21784	The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .
21785	A Board of Control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .
21786	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
21789	Rated triple-A by both Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through Salomon Brothers Inc .

21814	Bonds due 2003 , 2004 and 2015 are n't being formally reoffered .
21815	There are also $ 40 million of uninsured subordinate lien bonds , due Dec. 1 , 2008 , and Dec. 1 , 2015 .
21816	There are $ 15,015,000 of 7 1\/2 % bonds priced at par and due 2008 and $ 24,985,000 of 7.6 % bonds priced at par and due 2015 .
21817	The insured bonds are rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P .
21819	West Virginia Parkways , Economic Development and Tourism Authority -- $ 143 million of parkway revenue bonds , Series 1989 , with current interest bonds due 1990-2002 and 2019 and capital appreciation bonds due 2003-2008 , tentatively priced by a PaineWebber Inc. group to yield from 6 % in 1990 to 7.31 % in 2019 .

21823	The bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P .
21830	The bonds , rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P , were priced to yield from 5.75 % in 1990 to 6.90 % in 2006 to 2009 .
21844	Nippon Signal Co . -LRB- Japan -RRB- -- 80 million marks of bonds with equity-purchase warrants , indicating a 1 1\/2 % coupon , due Nov. 9 , 1994 , and priced at par , via Commerzbank .
21846	Each 5,000 mark bond carries one warrant and one certificate for four warrants , exercisable from Dec. 18 , 1989 , to Oct. 26 , 1994 , to buy shares at an expected premium of 2 1\/2 % above the closing share price when prices are fixed Oct. 30 .
21860	Ironically , the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active , results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal , state and local regulators .
21861	Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it .
21864	`` A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses , '' says Marian Jacob , a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop .
21867	Meanwhile , they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished .
21868	To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most , the Journal asked a completely unscientific , random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail .
21870	They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses .
21871	Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior , generally the best regarded form of red tape , `` create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away , '' says Sidney West , president of TechDesign International Inc. , a Springfield , Va. , business that designs telecommunication and other products .
21872	Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment : `` They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market . ''
21875	There is such a maze of federal , state and local codes that `` building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them , '' Mr. Dooling says .
21876	Taxi , leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies .
21877	`` It 's very costly and time-consuming , '' says Phil Rosen , a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc. , a Boston car-leasing company .
21880	The most onerous , many entrepreneurs say , is the record-keeping and filing required by tax authorities .
21881	Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second .
21886	Peter Gebhard , the company 's owner , says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30 % this year to $ 100,000 .
21887	Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses .
21888	Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president .
21891	Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $ 3,000 within three days after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that 's a big problem for small businesses .
21892	It 's especially nettlesome `` if you 're on the road and you 're the one responsible , '' says Eddie Brown , president of Brown Capital Management Inc. , a Baltimore money-management firm .
21894	Revising employee manuals on pensions , health care and other subjects costs over $ 25,000 a year for Bert Giguiere , president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc. , a Fresno , Calif. , provider of business services to farmers .
21896	But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that `` you need professionals to help you ; you ca n't do it yourself , '' he adds .
21897	PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES :
21899	Yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans .
21900	Alice Fixx , who runs her own public-relations concern in New York , says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans three times in the past three years .
21901	`` It does n't increase benefits , but it 's costly and time-consuming , '' Ms. Fixx says .
21904	Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews .
21905	To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense .
21908	Ms. Bogart , an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein 's `` South Pacific , '' is decidedly downtown .
21909	Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters , still hosting an annual `` A Christmas Carol . ''
21915	For Ms. Bogart , who initially studied and directed in Germany -LRB- and cites such European directors as Peter Stein , Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences -RRB- tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not .
21918	And `` Summerfolk , '' penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov 's `` Cherry Orchard , '' is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers .
21920	Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky 's time and place intact .
21921	Despite the absence of samovars -LRB- and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down -RRB- , the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton , with boaters and fishing poles aplenty .
21922	But beyond this decorative nod to tradition , Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky 's naturalistic drama into something akin to , well , farce .
21923	The director 's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered .
21924	Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them , but they often literally stand on their heads .
21926	There are moments in this `` Summerfolk '' when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house -LRB- which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich -RRB- spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of `` Laugh In . ''
21928	The clash of ideologies survives this treatment , but the nuance and richness of Gorky 's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle .
21929	As for the humor that Gorky 's text provides , when repainted in such broad strokes -LRB- particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble -RRB- it looks and sounds forced .
21931	Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern , whom she appointed Trinity 's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $ 60,000 sound system and recording studio .
21932	For Gorky , Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff , which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view .
21933	Like Brecht , and indeed Ezra Pound , Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to `` make it new . ''
21936	Ms. Bogart 's cast is part and parcel of the problem .
21937	Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna .
21939	Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse .
21942	But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer , Jonathan Fried -LRB- Zamislov , the paralegal -RRB- who is the actor to watch , whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor 's wife -LRB- Becca Lish -RRB- by licking her bosom .
21948	ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from Inco , as the Toronto company is called .
21952	ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a `` white knight '' as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray , a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $ 34 a share .
21953	Gray was advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch .
21954	ESB directors warmly accepted , but a whirlwind bidding match ensued .
21955	Within a few days in July , Inco raised its bid to $ 36 and United matched it .
21956	On a single day Inco lifted its offer to $ 38 and then to $ 41 , equal to $ 225.5 million .
21957	United met the $ 38 but then withdrew .
21958	ESB on July 29 accepted the Inco offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over .
21961	Early this year Morgan and three other investment houses each received $ 25 million in advisory fees from Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts in its $ 25 billion friendly buy-out of RJR Nabisco .
21962	HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14 % to $ 23.9 million , or $ 1.10 per fully diluted share , from $ 27.9 million , or $ 1.21 a fully diluted share , because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property .
21963	The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed 's stock , which lost 8.6 % of its value , closing at $ 38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange , down $ 3.625 .
21964	HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market .
21966	However , HomeFed 's loan originations and purchases plunged 26 % in the quarter , to $ 1.4 billion from $ 1.9 billion a year earlier .
21970	HomeFed said most of the troubled assets are apartment complexes , shopping malls and other commercial real estate .
21972	It said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter , but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year .
21975	But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill .
21979	For the nine months , HomeFed earned $ 82.5 million , or $ 3.52 a fully diluted share , a 4.3 % increase from year-earlier net income of $ 79.1 million , or $ 3.43 a fully diluted share .
21985	`` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . ''
21986	Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
21990	The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98 % .
21992	The average yield on six-month broker-sold CDs rose to 8.29 % from 8.05 % and on one-year CDs the average yield rose to 8.30 % from 8.09 % .
21993	The brokerage firms , which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell , generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on T-bills or from banks and thrifts directly .
21994	T-bills sold at Monday 's auction yielded 7.90 % for six months and 7.77 % for three months , up from 7.82 % and 7.61 % , respectively , the week before .
21995	So-called jumbo CDs , typically in denominations of $ 90,000 and up , also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors .
21996	Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields this week , both up and down .
21998	Six-month and oneyear yields were unchanged , on average .
22000	`` It 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market . ''
22004	In California , Bank of America dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year `` savings '' CDs to 8.33 % from 8.61 % .
22005	Yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average 6.96 % for $ 50,000 and less and down just a hundredth of a percentage point to 7.41 % for jumbo deposits .
22006	Lion Nathan Ltd. agreed to buy the franchise to bottle , distribute and market Pepsi-Cola soft-drink products in Australia , the company said .
22007	The New Zealand brewing and retail concern did n't disclose terms .
22008	The agreement is effective Jan. 1 and is subject to approval from Australia 's Foreign Investment Review Board .
22010	Lion Nathan and PepsiCola Australia , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. of the U.S. , did n't say why Cadbury Schweppes will no longer hold the franchise .
22011	Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $ 25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $ 187 million shortly , Richard Miller , president , said at the annual meeting .
22012	He said Wang had reached an agreement with a `` major financial firm '' to sell for $ 150 million its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its Wang Credit Corp. subsidiary .
22014	Mr. Miller said that Wang has already sold some $ 12 million of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $ 13 million from Compaq Computer Corp. , Houston , in the previously announced sale of its Stirling , Scotland , plant .
22015	Mr. Miller repeated that in the next six months he plans to sell another $ 200 million to $ 300 million of assets to repay debt and reduce interest costs at Wang , a minincomputer maker in Lowell , Mass .
22020	The company did n't disclose a purchase price or capitalization figures .
22025	Safeway Stores Inc. reported a 69 % decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter , but said operating improvements were masked by unusual gains in the year-earlier period .
22031	Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s .
22035	It sank further to as low as $ 145 , but a big rally developed in the last half hour , pushing the stock back up to close at $ 170 , down just $ 8.375 from Monday .
22037	Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out , the two Benjamin Jacobson specialists at the Big Board 's UAL trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all .
22049	Messrs. Jacobson and Bates walked on the Big Board floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble .
22050	Already entered in the Big Board 's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares .
22051	The UAL news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market , in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor .
22055	And at 9:15 , they posted a $ 135 to $ 155 `` first indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open .
22062	Mr. Jacobson , his gray hair flying , did n't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers , but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt .
22064	But yesterday , the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs. Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners , all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market .
22065	About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day , and probably hundreds more came and went -- a `` seething mass , '' as one trader described it .
22073	In Chicago , a UAL spokesman , `` by way of policy , '' declined to comment on the company 's stock or the specialists ' performance .
22076	Britain 's current account deficit dropped to # 1.6 billion -LRB- $ 2.56 billion -RRB- in September from an adjusted # 2 billion -LRB- $ 3.21 billion -RRB- the previous month , but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year .
22078	`` The outlook has deteriorated since the summer , with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said David Wigglesworth , chairman of the industry group 's economic committee .
22080	Of 1,224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while only 28 % plan to spend more .
22082	Unemployment , for example , has continued to decline , and the September trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports .
22084	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation , which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987 .
22085	Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies .
22086	Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday , Mr. Lawson said inflation `` remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being '' and promised to take `` whatever steps are needed '' to choke it off .
22089	David Owen , U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group , reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7 % from 1.2 % and termed the risk of recession next year `` quite high . ''
22090	But he said the downturn probably wo n't become a `` major contraction '' similar to those of 1974 and 1982 .
22092	Compared with the major economies on the Continent , the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months .
22093	As a result , Mr. Owen warned , investment will be more likely to flow toward the other European economies and `` the U.K. will be less prepared for the single market . ''
22096	The resulting # 1.9 billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of # 300 million in so-called invisible items , which include income from investments , services and official transfers .
22100	Vickers PLC , a British aerospace , defense and automotive conglomerate , said it reached an agreed cash bid of # 108.2 million -LRB- $ 173.3 million -RRB- for Ross Catherall Group PLC , a maker of specialty alloy and ceramics .
22101	The company said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of 253 pence -LRB- $ 4.05 -RRB- per share representing at least 67 % of Ross Catherall 's issued share capital , or 12.7 million ordinary shares .
22107	The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association , a Lexington , Ky.-based trade group , has launched `` seminars '' for `` potential investors '' at race tracks around the country .
22108	The group , which has held half a dozen seminars so far , also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers .
22113	Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm .
22115	But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
22116	`` It 's a big-risk business , '' warns Charles C. Mihalek , a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner .
22119	Consider Spendthrift Farm , a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year .
22121	Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights .
22127	Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner 's circle and high-society schmoozing .
22128	One handout promises : `` Pedigrees , parties , post times , parimutuels and pageantry . ''
22129	`` It 's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves , '' says Headley Bell , a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington .
22135	`` You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof , '' she tells the group .
22139	So owners have developed a `` code of ethics , '' outlining rules for consultants and agents , and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest .
22141	`` The industry is based on individual honesty , '' says Cap Hershey , a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift .
22144	At a yearling sale , a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars .
22146	For those looking for something between a minority stake and total ownership , the owners ' group is considering a special sale where established horse breeders would sell a 50 % stake in horses to newcomers .
22149	Buell recently said it would incur an aftertax charge of about $ 3.6 million in its fourth quarter ending Tuesday , in connection with the sale and discontinuance of several lines at a plant .
22150	The Waterbury , Conn. , maker of industrial fasteners and metal stampings has 2.3 million shares outstanding .
22152	Dunkin ' Donuts , based in Randolph , Mass. , previously said it would explore `` alternatives , '' including a leveraged buy-out of the company , but had n't set a date for submission of proposals .
22153	Dunkin ' Donuts Chairman and Chief Executive Robert M. Rosenberg said `` a sale is one alternative being considered , '' but he added the board has n't decided whether to sell the doughnut franchiser .
22154	DD Acquisition , jointly owned by Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit and Cara Operations Ltd. , has made a $ 45-a-share tender offer valued at $ 268 million for Dunkin ' Donuts .
22158	The Stamford , Conn. , power-generation products and services company said per-share earnings were 56 cents compared with the year-ago loss of $ 2.39 .
22160	Strong profit in the process industries , including chemical and pulp and paper , were offset by higher interest expense and by lower earnings as the company closed out certain long-term contracts .
22161	Combustion reported improved profits in its automation and control products businesses , and it narrowed its losses in its public sector and environmental segment .
22162	Power generation had higher sales but lower earnings ; the company cited factors including work on certain low profit-margin contracts from previous years .
22164	Last year 's results reflected a gain of $ 28.2 million on disposition of assets and a $ 165 million pretax provision mainly from costs of completing certain waste-to-energy and other power plants .
22165	Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer , of Axa-Midi Assurances , pledged to retain employees and management of Farmers Group Inc. , including Leo E. Denlea Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer , if Axa succeeds in acquiring Farmers .
22166	Mr. Bebear added that the French insurer would keep Farmers ' headquarters in Los Angeles and `` will not send French people to run the company . ''
22169	The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $ 5.2 billion .
22171	Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates , and Mr. Bebear 's trip will take him to Idaho , Arizona and New York after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press .
22172	Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon .
22173	Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas .
22175	Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa .
22176	He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies , and would `` help define policies and strategies of the group . ''
22179	Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for the exchanges , '' a Farmers spokesman said .
22182	The stake was acquired by a group of 10 Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations , primarily insurance companies , Honeywell said .
22189	The distribution represents available cash flow from the partnership between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 .
22191	The money manager is controlled 67.7 % by its top officers and top officers of Oppenheimer & Co. , a securities firm .
22196	The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year ending Tuesday .
22203	The media concern said net income rose to $ 37.8 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
22204	The latest results include a gain of $ 4.2 million , or eight cents a share , on the sale of television stations in Oklahoma City and Flint , Mich .
22212	The company plans to raise between C$ 75 million and C$ 100 million from the offering , according to a spokeswoman at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. , lead underwriter .
22214	General Electric Co. executives and lawyers provided `` misleading and false '' information to the Pentagon in 1985 in an effort to cover up `` longstanding fraudulent '' billing practices , federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs .
22215	The government 's startling allegations , filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor .
22216	In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . ''
22217	The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices .
22218	The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance .
22219	The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices .
22220	But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
22222	The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents .
22223	Last November , a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract .
22226	The government 's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts .
22227	GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ 1 million in the Minuteman case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court .
22228	In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , prosecutors contend that `` high-level GE executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985 .
22229	Overall , the government contends that GE 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with Pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations .
22233	GE , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior GE managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives .
22234	Subsequent meetings , initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company 's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to GE .
22236	The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' GE 's brief asserts .
22237	`` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . ''
22239	Applied Solar Energy Corp. of City of Industry , Calif. , said it and its majority shareholder , American Cyanamid Co. , signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of Applied Solar by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for about $ 38 million .
22240	The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of $ 10 a share at closing and a contingent payment of as much as 80 cents a share placed in escrow .
22243	American Cyanamid is a Wayne , N.J. , chemicals , drugs and fertilizer concern .
22244	Completion of the acquisition is subject to execution of a definitive agreement , approval by all three companies ' boards and the approval of Applied Solar 's shareholders .
22245	An Applied Solar spokesman said completion is expected at the end of the year or early next year .
22246	A spokeswoman for the St. Louis aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because Applied Solar is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components , and this fits with McDonnell 's business of laser applications for military space .
22247	Trading in Cineplex Odeon Corp. shares was halted on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges late yesterday afternoon at the company 's request , Toronto Stock Exchange officials said .
22248	Brian Hemming , a spokesman for the company 's committee of independent directors , established in May to solicit and evaluate offers for the company , said it was expected to make an announcement early this morning .
22249	But Mr. Hemming said he was n't aware of the nature of the talks under way between committee members and their advisers .
22251	Analysts have speculated in recent days that the value of offers received by the committee fell well short of what they had hoped , or even that the company 's chairman , president and chief executive officer , Garth Drabinsky , is the only bidder for the company as a whole .
22252	The current effort to auction off the company was triggered by a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and the Toronto-based movie chain 's major shareholder , MCA Inc .
22253	London share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday on the back of Wall Street 's steep drop and renewed fears over U.K. economic fundamentals .
22254	Tokyo 's winning streak came to an end , and stocks fell in Frankfurt and across Europe as well .
22257	Dealers said the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year .
22258	The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K. , dealers said .
22260	Volume was a modest 405.4 million shares traded , but better than the year 's lowest turnover of 276.8 million Monday .
22262	They added that market-makers were knocking share prices down in midafternoon in a bid to attract some interest , but the action largely helped open the way for London 's late declines .
22263	Insurance stocks provided some early support to the market , partly on favorable brokerage recommendatons and talk of continental European interest in British life and composite insurers .
22264	British life insurer London & General , which firmed 2 pence to 356 pence -LRB- $ 5.70 -RRB- , and composite insurer Royal Insurance , which finished 13 lower at 475 , were featured in the talk .
22265	On the life insurance side , Pearl Group finished 5 lower at 640 , and Sun Life dropped 15 to # 11.53 .
22267	Dealers said the market did n't react substantially to Ford Motor Co. 's disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will seek 100 % of Jaguar 's shares outstanding when U.K. government share regulations are lifted at the end of next year .
22275	The market , however , is expected to remain stable and expectations for future gains are high , traders said .
22276	Such sentiment is being supported by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled to enter the market later this week and in early November .
22282	On the other hand , high-priced shares such as Pioneer Electronic and Sony failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds , observers said .
22285	TDK fell 120 to 5,960 , Fuji Photo Film declined 160 to 4,830 , and Fanuc dropped 160 to 7,440 .
22291	Market participants say investors are not only licking their wounds following the turbulence last week , but they have also been made nervous by two events in West Germany .
22296	The decline in prices cut broadly through the blue-chip issues , as Siemens tumbled 7.5 to 544 , Deutsche Bank plunged 7 to 657 , and the auto makers fell sharply as well .
22297	Daimler-Benz dropped 12.5 to 710.5 , Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 10.5 to 543.5 , and Volkswagen lost 7.1 .
22298	Elsewhere , share prices closed lower in Zurich , Amsterdam , Milan and Stockholm .
22300	Prices closed lower in Sydney , Singapore and Wellington , were mixed in Hong Kong and higher in Taipei , Manila , Paris , Brussels and Seoul .
22304	Directors of Bergen Bank and Den Norske Creditbank , two of Norway 's leading banks , announced they had agreed to the formal merger of the banks .
22311	Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites , the Office of Thrift Supervision said .
22313	The office , an arm of the Treasury , said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often .
22315	They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws .
22316	Sen. Alan Dixon -LRB- D , Ill. -RRB- , chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs , said , `` I 'm not a statistician .
22317	But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities , it is three and four times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem . ''
22318	James Grohl , a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions , said , `` The data is a red flag , but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread . ''
22320	Sen. Dixon held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending .
22321	The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers , but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least .
22322	The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites .
22323	But John LaWare , a Fed governor , told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed 's believes the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating .
22325	Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination .
22327	`` If we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . ''
22328	Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws .
22332	The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited .
22335	The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing .
22336	Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions , but Mr. Grohl said the U.S. League of Savings Institutions had n't yet taken any position on the matter .
22342	Tele-Communications is HBO 's largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships .
22345	Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York , where Viacom in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime .
22346	Executives involved in plotting Time 's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants .
22347	The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated , or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime .
22353	Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million .
22354	In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power .
22355	Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite .
22356	Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business .
22359	Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated .
22360	Meanwhile , some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom 's antitrust suit against Time .
22361	Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service , The Movie Channel , on Time 's Manhattan Cable TV system , one of the nation 's largest urban systems .
22364	But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios , and yesterday announced it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO .
22367	The FTC said it would seek to enjoin the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court , but declined to specify which one .
22369	Officials at the United Scientific unit , Optic-Electronic Corp. of Garland , Texas , and at Imo Industries of Lawrenceville , N.J. , could n't be reached for comment .
22371	Citing rising fuel costs , promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel , several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results .
22375	Airlines in 1989 `` came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper , '' said Kevin Murphy , an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co .
22376	This turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible last spring , when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets .
22383	Just last week , for example , Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $ 200 to $ 1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class .
22384	The industry 's slowdown became apparent this month when AMR Corp. , parent of American Airlines , reported an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be `` disappointing . ''
22387	Its loss of $ 77.7 million , or $ 1.86 a share , contrasted with net of $ 68.5 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the 1988 third quarter .
22389	For the nine months , the Arlington , Va. , company 's net plunged 73 % to $ 38.5 million , or 76 cents a share , from $ 142.2 million , or $ 3.28 a share .
22391	The results surprised many analysts , because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines .
22398	To try to combat the traffic slowdown , airlines started reducing fares ; average fares rose only 1.7 % in August , in contrast to increases of 16 % each in February and March .
22399	But so far , the effort has failed , and traffic is still slow .
22402	Airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week , but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected .
22408	And some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches : USAir , for example , blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo last month .
22409	`` We can not quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo , '' said Edwin Colodny , chairman and president of USAir Group .
22412	As for 1990 , the firm predicts that profit will slip to between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion .
22418	Turns out that next year , Charlie Brown , Snoopy and the gang turn 40 -- and Scripps Howard 's United Media unit , the syndicator and licensing agent for Charles Schulz 's comic strip , sees a bonanza in licensing the cartoon characters to a bevy of advertisers for ads , tie-ins and promotions .
22419	`` Peanuts has become a major part of American culture , '' says Peter Shore , United Media 's vice president of marketing and licensing .
22421	Our plan is to honor Charles Schulz and the strip all year long . ''
22425	Ralston Purina will promote its Chex Party Mix 's three new flavor packets named for Charlie Brown , Lucy and Linus .
22427	Beyond the advertisements , the syndicator is planning a traveling arena show , new TV specials for CBS and even an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institute .
22428	The yearlong schedule of festivities will be kicked off officially with a combination live and animation half-time special at the Super Bowl in January .
22431	`` If you want to cut through the clutter , you have to make your message as distinct , sharp and individual as possible .
22436	But Mr. Shore says that company 's exclusive advertising rights extend only to the insurance and financial services category .
22439	Mr. Berry , 58 , had resigned after being asked by Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , Kenneth Roman , to give up his title as creative head of the New York office and to take a fuzzier international role .
22441	Mr. Berry said the timing was a coincidence and that his decision was unrelated to Mr. Roman 's departure .
22444	The naming of FCB\/Leber Katz Partners as agency of record for Nabisco Brands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers Co. follows RJR Nabisco 's announcement last week that it will disband its RJR Nabisco Broadcast division and dismiss its 14 employees Dec. 1. to cut costs .
22445	New York-based RJR Nabisco would n't say what it spends annually , but industry executives say it will spend more than $ 140 million this year , down from about $ 200 million last year .
22448	Interpublic Group of Cos. said third-quarter net rose 15 % to $ 6.9 million , or 21 cents a share , from $ 6 million , or 18 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
22453	International Business Machines Corp. agreed to acquire a 15 % stake in Paxus Corp. , an Australian computer-software and information-services concern , for 20 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 17 million -RRB- .
22455	IBM can raise its stake in Paxus to 20 % over three years , but agreed to not go beyond 20 % in that time .
22456	Paxus said in a statement it has several `` well developed product and services relationships '' with the U.S. computer company , and plans to expand these links .
22457	The company earns about half its revenue overseas and plans further expansion .
22459	The agreement requires approval from Australia 's Foreign Investment Review Board and National Companies and Securities Commission , and from shareholders of Paxus .
22461	Alan Bond , chairman and controlling shareholder of the cash-strapped Australian media , brewing , resources and property concern , disclosed the debt figures yesterday .
22465	He predicted the debt will be reduced by another A$ 3.8 billion this fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , but did n't explain how this will be achieved .
22466	Mr. Bond blamed rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of Bell Group `` with its very high levels of shortterm debt '' for producing a condition `` that was no longer sustainable .
22467	`` In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders , '' Mr. Bond said , `` we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the group . ''
22471	Among these are the company 's Australian brewing assets , in the books at A$ 950 million but actually worth A$ 2.5 billion , he said .
22472	An investment in Chile 's telephone company is carried at US$ 300 million but really worth US$ 500 million , and the company 's property portfolio is undervalued by at least A$ 250 million , Mr. Bond said .
22473	Mr. Bond forecast that by next June , `` what will emerge will be a company with a honed sense of purpose ... a stable balance sheet , with good-quality assets in brewing , telecommunications , media and property . ''
22474	He did n't name energy resources in that list , signaling that all the company 's coal and oil interests might be for sale in total or in part .
22481	Mr. Krampe also said that Mercedes plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus , Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti and Honda Motor Co. 's Acura luxury-car divisions .
22482	Homestake Mining Co. , San Francisco , blamed the continued slump in gold prices for an 83 % plunge in third-quarter net income to $ 2 million , or two cents a share , from $ 11.2 million , or 12 cents a share , a year earlier .
22486	For the nine months , the mining company posted a 40 % drop in profit to $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , from $ 50.6 million , or 52 cents a share , on a 6 % rise in revenue to $ 323.2 million from $ 305.7 million .
22488	The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing Feb. 1 , 1990 , and May 3 , 1990 , respectively .
22489	Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
22492	A year ago , the Minneapolis glass products and aluminum window maker earned $ 4 million , or 30 cents a share , on revenue of $ 114 million .
22494	Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own , making it necessary for Apogee to advance cash to ensure completion of the project .
22495	The company said its core businesses have performed well and it expects them to continue to do so in the remainder of the fiscal year .
22496	Japan 's production of cars , trucks and buses in September fell 4.1 % from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers ' Association said .
22497	Domestic demand continues to grow , but its contribution to higher production was sapped in September by the estimated 2 % fall in imports , accompanied by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to build vehicles overseas , according to the association .
22505	Midsized cars accounted for the greatest growth in units , rising 62,872 units to 134,550 units , or 88 % .
22511	The association spokesman said bus production has declined since January , but could n't offer an explanation for the fall .
22514	Stock of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the UAL board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction .
22517	But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market .
22521	Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding .
22523	The two most frequently rumored buyers , neither of whom would comment , were Coniston Partners , which battled the UAL board in 1987 , and New York real estate developer Donald Trump , who recently made and withdrew an offer for American Airlines parent AMR Corp .
22534	Any investor who acquires UAL stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with United 's contentious unions .
22535	The pilots are working under an expired contract , and the machinists contract expires next month .
22536	That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose .
22538	The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion .
22539	One person familiar with UAL said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid `` rushing around selling the company at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month .
22543	Another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their UAL stock at the bottom , but already own so much they ca n't buy any more .
22545	`` They check in , but they ca n't check out . ''
22546	But both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction .
22549	The machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for recapitalizations that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake .
22555	A source close to Carl Icahn , a corporate raider who owns Trans World Airlines Inc. , said he has n't owned any UAL stock and is n't buying .
22557	And a spokesman for Reliance Group Holdings Inc. , which had held 7 % of UAL before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below 5 % , would n't comment .
22559	The Los Angeles investor ca n't buy UAL stock , solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ 300 a share or UAL accepts an offer below $ 300 .
22560	However , Mr. Davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be waived , or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price .
22561	Times Mirror Co. said third-quarter net income fell 13 % to $ 70.1 million , or 54 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 81 million , or 62 cents a share , a year earlier .
22564	Stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and textbook publishing divisions , plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper , the Los Angeles Times , offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the Eastern U.S. , the company said .
22565	`` Looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the outlook for the newspaper group remains guarded , with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our Eastern markets , '' said Robert F. Erburu , Times Mirror 's chairman and chief executive .
22566	Copper futures sold off sharply yesterday , influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar , and a rally in bonds .
22567	December copper opened near Monday 's close , tried to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ 1.1510 a pound , off 4.50 cents for the day .
22575	When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their positions .
22579	Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year .
22583	She noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about 2.5 % to 3 % .
22586	Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers came out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said .
22590	However , David Threlkeld , president of Threlkeld & Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year .
22595	According to Mr. Threlkeld , the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries .
22604	Several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking .
22606	The industrial average recovered to close only 3.69 points lower , but petroleum futures never shook off the chill .
22613	He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases , but the sales do n't seem to have materialized .
22614	Ms. Raptopoulos thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar .
22617	`` The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said .
22618	GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather .
22619	The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government 's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday , but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday , said Dale Gustafson , a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago .
22622	COCOA : Futures at first continued the rally begun on Monday , but then faltered and closed lower .
22623	The December contract opened just under Monday 's close , triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ 1,030 a metric ton , pushing the price to $ 1,040 , and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests .
22628	The December contract reached its life-of-contract low of $ 975 a ton on Oct. 11 ; its lifetime high was $ 1,735 , set in 1988 , and its recent high was $ 1,368 , set in early August .
22631	Citizens First Bancorp . Inc. said it agreed to buy Lakeland First Financial Group Inc. , a Succasunna , N.J. , bank holding company , for about $ 50.6 million in cash and stock .
22632	Citizens First , which controls Citizens First National Bank and is based in Glen Rock , N.J. , will pay a maximum of 40 % in cash for the parent of Lakeland Savings Bank and the remainder in convertible preferred stock , with a liquidation value of $ 18 a share .
22633	Lakeland holders will have the option to request either stock or cash .
22634	The convertible preferred will pay dividends at 7.875 % and be convertible into shares of Citizens First at a rate equal to 20 % above the average closing price of the stock during a 20-day period prior to the transaction 's completion .
22635	The deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval .
22637	The agreement also calls for General Electric Pension , a unit of General Electric Co. , to receive as much as 10 % of Color Systems ' fully diluted common stock , depending on the proceeds from the sale of the AEI Film Library and its receivables .
22641	Color Systems , which converts black-and-white film to color videotape , posted a loss of $ 7.1 million , or $ 1.32 a share , on revenue of $ 10.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30 .
22646	The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO , a set of assets that were leveraged twice , enabling the blue-chip buy-out king Henry Kravis in 1987 to take more than $ 1 billion of cash out of the com - pany .
22647	SCI TV 's buy-out was an ace in the hole for Mr. Kravis and for investors in KKR partnerships .
22648	But it has left holders of SCI TV 's junk bonds holding the bag , including some heavyweights that KKR might need to finance future deals , such as Kemper Financial Services , First Executive , Columbia Savings & Loan and Prudential Insurance Co. of America .
22649	Some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against KKR or moves to force SCI TV into bankruptcy court .
22652	KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out , then later sold Storer 's cable operations at a fat profit .
22653	In 1987 , KKR for the second time piled debt onto Storer 's TV stations , selling them for $ 1.3 billion to a new entity that was 45%-owned by KKR and 55%-owned by Gillett Corp. , which now operates the SCI TV stations .
22654	In this second LBO , KKR with one hand took more than $ 1 billion of cash out of the TV company 's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations , making them more valuable in a 1988 sale .
22656	With the other hand , KKR put back into SCI TV less than 10 % of the cash it had taken out , buying SCI TV common and preferred shares .
22657	So , while KKR today has an estimated $ 250 million sunk in now-shaky SCI TV , including equity and debt , the LBO firm still is $ 1 billion ahead on the SCI TV buy-out after taking cash up front .
22660	Overall , Mr. Gillett 's holding company , Gillett Holdings , is heavily indebted and , except for its Vail Mountain resorts , is n't doing very well .
22661	With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years , analysts say that if SCI TV had to be liquidated today , it might fetch 30 % less than in the 1987 buy-out , wiping out most of the company 's junk-holders and its stockholders .
22662	Meanwhile , SCI TV can barely pay its cash interest bill , and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due .
22665	Negotiations `` have started con - structively , but that 's not to say we like this particular offer , '' says Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc. , adviser to SCI TV junk-holders .
22669	Mr. Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a Detroit station .
22672	People who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp .
22677	Kemper , the biggest holder of senior SCI TV bonds , has refused to join the bond-holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options .
22678	To protect their claims , some junk-holders want KKR and perhaps Mr. Gillett to invest new money in SCI TV , perhaps $ 50 million or more .
22682	A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish KKR 's name , and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in Washington and elsewhere .
22692	Rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company , but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened .
22694	Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments , but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25 % or more of Rubbermaid 's voting securities , each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy Rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price .
22696	For the third quarter , Rubbermaid earned $ 32.6 million , or 44 cents a share , up 16 % from $ 28.1 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .
22699	The stock market went on a dizzying ride as UAL , parent of United Airlines , once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback .
22704	Yesterday 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that 11 days after the 190-point plunge on Friday the 13th , the stock market still has a bad case of nerves .
22705	Takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges .
22707	`` October 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve , '' said Jack Solomon , technical analyst for Bear Stearns .
22708	`` People are fearful and sensitive .
22714	As stocks and stock-index futures fell , a trading limit was hit in the S&P 500 stock futures pit .
22717	But at a critical moment , stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control .
22719	At about 10:40 a.m. EDT , several big buy orders hit the S&P pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks .
22722	Traders said Goldman Sachs , Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment .
22724	Officials at Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were unavailable for comment .
22727	Five minutes before the Big Board opened , a preliminary price was flashed for UAL -- somewhere between 135 and 155 , a loss of as much as $ 43 a share from Monday 's close .
22733	Shortly after the UAL opening , program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index .
22736	All 20-stocks in the MMI except Exxon , General Motors and Sears were down $ 1 to $ 2 .
22737	At 10:33 , when the S&P 500 December futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs , S&P futures trading was halted and program trades on the Big Board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances .
22738	Under the rules adopted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , the futures contract can not drop below the limit , but buyers can purchase futures .
22739	At this point , the Dow industrials were down 75.41 points and falling .
22740	The trading halt in the S&P 500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion , many traders maintain .
22741	But as the fright began to spread through the S&P pit , the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively .
22746	These firms sold stock into the big morning decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S&P futures hit the trading limit .
22765	Other issues said to be included in the buy program were Procter & Gamble , which rose 2 7\/8 to 133 1\/2 ; Atlantic Richfield , which gained 2 to 103 3\/4 , and Rockwell International , which jumped 2 3\/4 to 27 1\/8 .
22770	AMR , the parent of American Airlines , fell 1 3\/4 to 68 7\/8 on 2.3 million shares ; Delta Air Lines lost 1 1\/2 to 66 , Southwest Airlines slid 3\/4 to 24 1\/4 and Midway Airlines dropped 1\/4 to 14 7\/8 .
22771	Texas Air , which owns Continental and Eastern airlines , lost 3\/8 to 13 1\/8 on the American Stock Exchange .
22773	Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 1\/2 to 70 1\/4 , Phelps Dodge fell 4 to 59 7\/8 , Asarco lost 1 3\/8 to 31 3\/4 , Reynolds Metals slid 1 3\/8 to 50 3\/8 , Amax dropped 1 1\/8 to 21 5\/8 and Cyprus Minerals skidded 2 to 26 3\/4 .
22776	Its third-quarter earnings were higher than a year ago , but fell short of expectations .

22804	Fireman 's Fund Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 85 % to $ 7.2 million from last year 's $ 49.1 million , or 99 cents a share , because of ravages of Hurricane Hugo and increased reserves for legal expenses .

22850	Adding to the junk market 's jitters were reports that Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. is having trouble structuring a $ 1.6 billion offering for TW Food Services Inc. and will postpone or even cancel the issue .
22851	TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee 's , a fast-food restaurant , and operates several other food chains .
22853	Credit analysts said investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt .
22854	Also , the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular .
22857	`` People are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but they 're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market . ''
22864	Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers .
22866	`` They are typically not active in two-year note auctions , but today 's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal . ''
22867	However , Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline .
22873	A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds .

23052	Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd 's , the world 's largest insurance market , generally do n't close their accounts for three years , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation .
23053	When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
23055	The open-year accounting practice `` is widely recognized within Lloyd 's as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at Lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income , Lloyd 's said .
23056	The procedure causes `` great uncertainty '' because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability , Lloyd 's said .

23068	In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed .

23079	Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery .
23080	The private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots .
23082	`` We want people to think of Lake View as an historical park and educational experience ... .
23083	A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours . ''
23089	But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View , promoters believe : Ernest Ball , for instance , who wrote `` When Irish Eyes are Smiling , '' and Garrett Morgan , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light .
23097	Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue 's London debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares . ''
23099	Official trading in the shares will start in London , Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6 , when the French-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of nearly $ 1 billion , comes to market in the European Community .

23107	Albert Fried Jr. , a 59-year-old director and holder of a 9.5 % stake in the company , was named chairman of this maker of products for the construction equipment , material handling and railroad industries .

23111	The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
23112	Ford did n't say how much it might offer for Jaguar , or when .
23114	But with its stake in Jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner .
23117	He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . ''
23119	Since then , Jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with GM and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month .
23120	Analysts have been expecting a GM-Jaguar pact that would give the U.S. car maker an eventual 30 % stake in the British company and create joint ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars .
23122	Jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving GM a minority stake , said one individual close to the talks , adding , `` It would n't surprise me if -LCB- Jaguar executives -RCB- want to wait and see what the color of that -LCB- Ford bid -RCB- is '' first .
23124	Sir John Egan , Jaguar 's chairman , so far has refused to meet with Ford officials , but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal .
23129	A pitched battle could mean Jaguar would fetch # 10 -LRB- $ 16.02 -RRB- a share , or about # 1.8 billion -LRB- $ 2.88 billion -RRB- , several analysts believe .
23134	Both Ford and GM badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the European and U.S. markets .
23135	And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how .
23137	Ford 's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S. .
23140	Its Opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models , but it lacks Jaguar 's cachet .
23141	GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC , a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986 .
23144	Meanwhile , like many other oil companies hurt by less-profitable downstream businesses , Mobil Corp. , Shell Oil Co. and Chevron Corp. reported lower quarterly earnings .

23154	Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share .
23158	Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field , a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year .
23159	Results declined , however , in Sun 's refining and marketing and coal businesses .
23161	Profits of Shell , a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch\/Shell Group , tumbled $ 24 million , or 6.6 % , to $ 340 million , despite a gain of $ 30 million from an insurance settlement .
23162	President Frank Richardson attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices , which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of Shell 's exploration and production operation .
23164	Shell 's chemical earnings fell by $ 67 million , to $ 137 million , reflecting lower margins and less demand for commodity chemicals .
23166	Net income at Mobil Corp. slipped 4.5 % to $ 532 million , or $ 1.30 a share , from $ 557 million , or $ 1.36 a share .
23169	Exploration and production profits slumped $ 40 million due to a provision for restructuring costs .
23170	The restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will involve the transfer and layoff of employees in U.S. operations to reduce costs and focus efforts in other areas .
23171	Last year , third-quarter earnings included a $ 157 million gain from foreign tax rate changes and a loss from a $ 65 million write-off of reserves .
23173	Chevron 's net income fell 0.7 % , to $ 417 million , or $ 1.22 a share , from $ 420 million , or $ 1.23 a share .
23174	Results included a $ 37 million gain from the sale of rights from Chevron 's investment in Amax Inc. , and a loss of $ 30 million from the sale of California oil and gas properties .
23176	Chevron said higher crude oil prices boosted profits from production operations , but margins in refining and marketing declined .
23177	Profits from U.S. exploration and production operations totaled $ 58 million , after the property sale loss , compared with a year-earlier $ 44 million loss that included a $ 16 million reorganization charge .
23178	Refining and marketing operations earned $ 130 million in the quarter this year , compared with earnings of $ 186 million a year earlier that included $ 18 million in charges for environmental programs .
23179	Foreign earnings fell to $ 180 million from $ 182 million that included a $ 48 million gain from lower Canadian and Australian taxes .
23182	Asarco Inc. , continuing its effort to refocus its business , ended its involvement in asbestos mining in the third quarter and said it would stop mining and selling coal by year end .
23183	The mining , metal and specialty-chemical concern said combined revenue for asbestos and coal was about $ 40 million of the company 's total revenue in 1988 of $ 1.98 billion .
23184	Richard de J. Osborne , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said the company 's `` decisions to get out of asbestos and high-sulfur coal continue the process of simplifying and focusing the company in areas with a better future . ''
23185	Asarco also reported third-quarter net income rose 14 % , to $ 52.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , from a restated $ 46.2 million , or $ 1.10 a share , a year earlier .
23186	Asarco said the gain reflected continued strength in prices for refined copper , lead and zinc , and higher equity earnings in Mexico Desarrollo Industrial Minero S.A. , a Mexican mining company in which Asarco has a 34 % stake .
23190	Asarco said it plans to shut down or sell its Rapatee coal mine and will end its involvement in southern Illinois strip mining .
23191	The company said that it is discussing a management-employee buy-out of the facility , but that it would stop mining and selling coal at year end when existing sales contracts expire , regardless of the outcome of those talks .
23194	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
23195	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .

23219	He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. until July , when he was named co-chairman of the investment-banking firm along with Howard L. Blum Jr. , who then became the sole chief executive .
23220	Yesterday , Mr. Blum , 41 , said he was n't aware of plans at Ladenburg to name a co-chairman to succeed Mr. Koenig and said the board would need to approve any appointments or title changes .
23221	Mr. Blum added he was n't surprised Mr. Koenig resigned , but his departure was `` nothing that we desired or worked for . ''

23259	The state agency , which usually publishes the data on monthly basis , but traditionally combines the index for the two summer-holiday months , said the advance was led by output of consumer goods , which rose 3.5 % from June and was up 7.2 % from a year earlier .
23260	Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing , with a monthly rise of 2 % and a year-on-year advance of 3 % .

23262	Output in the capital-goods sector was ahead 0.9 % on a monthly basis and 2.7 % year on year .

23267	The maker of animal health and nutrition products said the business , Creations Aromatiques of Port Valais , Switzerland , and Woodside , N.Y. , is a division of its Mallinckrodt Inc. subsidiary and had sales of about $ 30 million for its most recent year .

23274	But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results .
23278	Dr. Yonehara and his partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS-infected cells within three days .
23284	The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday .
23285	But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''
23286	He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody .
23289	But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects .
23290	`` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara .
23292	AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure .
23293	Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests .

23312	A # 320 million -LRB- $ 508 million -RRB- British Airways PLC rights issue flopped badly -- the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp .
23315	British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3 % of the convertible capital bonds , but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters .
23320	In a statement , British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was `` obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue . ''
23323	Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors .
23326	And instead of buying the UAL stake , the U.K. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest .
23338	`` There is no difference of opinion between -LRB- Chairman -RRB- Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy .
23340	Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they said was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities .
23343	`` Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity ? '' he asks .
23351	Du Pont Co. in a couple of units has installed objective tests based on earnings or return on equity .

23360	University of Michigan researchers find the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning , product development and design , including decision-making back in Japan .
23361	`` You ca n't hire competent Americans and say , ` Let them run only their own show , ' '' says Vladimir Pucik , who headed the study run with Egon Zehnder International , a search firm .
23363	In Japan , by contrast , companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within .
23371	More than half the people surveyed for the Employee Benefit Research Institute say they would be willing and able to pick up most of the cost of the coverage .

23394	The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results .
23395	Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
23396	With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year 's campaign , the Republicans are seen drawing support for their `` Germans First '' stand on social-welfare issues .
23397	Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread .
23400	`` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia .
23404	In a sign of easing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong , China said it will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into the British colony .
23408	Although Italy 's investigation of whether Olivetti had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known , this marked the first time the unit and product were named .
23414	In driftnet , or `` wall of death , '' fishing , fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path .
23415	Earlier this year , Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds , or down to 20 .
23417	The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses .
23420	Striking workers , who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13 , had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations .
23422	Before the two parties resumed talks last week , De Beers offered 17 % and the union wanted 37.6 % .
23426	But security systems , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily said .
23427	Besides money , criminals have also used computers to steal secrets and intelligence , the newspaper said , but it gave no more details .
23432	Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads .
23433	The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates .
23436	`` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors -LCB- primarily to greater speed -RCB- , '' according to NHTSA .
23437	The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between 1986 and last year , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986 .
23438	In states that raised the speed limit on rural interstates , the fatality rate rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988 .
23443	Public preference is important , So product names should match up , And firms that find they 're lagging behind Should now take steps to ketchup !
23458	Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses .
23461	This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms .
23462	Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
23465	Our traditional project loans have , for instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient , autonomous agencies .
23466	By and large , these efforts have borne fruit .
23471	As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness .
23472	Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector .
23474	Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp .
23475	Most recently , the Bank Group has been expanded to include the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate .
23476	These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government , as Mr. Roberts alleges .
23479	The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo .
23480	Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year .
23481	The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most important ones , corn and milk .
23482	Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods .
23483	The agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale .
23484	Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices .
23487	But most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into Conasupo government subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk .
23488	The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms .
23490	The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination .
23491	On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms .
23496	The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants .
23497	A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes .
23499	Your Sept. 26 `` Politics & Policy '' article about William Bennett 's Emergency Drug Plan for Washington gives the impression that the FBI has not been nor is actively involved .
23501	The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett 's initiative .
23503	Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market .
23504	The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department -LRB- MPD -RRB- .
23505	The FBI 's role is to complement the D.C. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations , but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes .
23506	In fact , we have agents assigned full time to assist the MPD in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence .
23508	Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28 , 1990 , the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield , N.J .
23509	Ramada 's previous plan was derailed by upheaval in the junk-bond market that hindered the offering of $ 400 million in high-yield securities of Aztar Corp. , the new company that will operate Ramada 's casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City ,
23510	Under the new terms , New World will still pay $ 540 million for Ramada 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but Ramada will now reimburse New World for $ 10 million in expenses .
23512	Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $ 1 in cash , subject to possible reduction , and one share of Aztar common stock .
23517	The announcement dispelled some Wall Street observers ' fears that New World might demand a huge premium for the delay , or scrap the deal entirely .
23521	Mr. Lee values the package at between $ 15 and $ 20 a share , based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks .
23522	The much-revised restructuring , which was first announced in October 1988 , must again be approved by shareholders and state casino regulators in Nevada and New Jersey .
23524	In May , Ramada sold its Marie Callender Pie Shops Inc. unit to a group of private investors as part of its plan to focus on its casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas and Laughlin , Nev .
23525	Bond prices took the high road and stock prices took the low road as worries mounted about the economy and the junk bond market .
23527	But long-term Treasury bonds staged a modest rally , with prices on most issues rising about half a point , or $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
23529	Traders and analysts said the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook .
23530	A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall .
23531	That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released .
23532	Analysts say they think durable goods orders fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % .
23537	`` Corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall , and the probability is that we 'll see negative economic growth in the fourth quarter . ''
23538	Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he said the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market .
23545	In late New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen , compared with 1.8578 marks and 142.43 yen late Friday .
23546	The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization .
23548	The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 .
23549	The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .
23550	Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data .
23554	-LRB- See related story : `` The American Way of Buying : Is Buying a Car a Choice or a Chore ? --
23556	You quote Robert Crandall , chairman of American 's parent , AMR Corp. , as having said that discount deals for big customers would be `` dumb '' because `` you will go to Detroit because you have to go to Detroit whether the fare is $ 175 , $ 275 or $ 375 . ''
23561	Perhaps the ethics of an industry 's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry .
23563	Meredith Corp. is launching a new service to offer advertisers package deals combining its book , magazine and videocassette products .
23564	The Des Moines-based publisher said it created a new Custom Marketing Group that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines , such as Ladies Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens .
23565	In addition , the group will create custom-designed media such as cookbooks , newspaper inserts and videos for ad campaigns .
23567	The Kraft package included a specially published cookbook , a national free-standing insert in Sunday newspapers , and a Kraft `` advertorial '' section that ran in five Meredith magazines .
23569	Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names .
23570	Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group .
23575	`` They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together , but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan , '' he said .
23576	Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners .
23579	Advertisers now say ` Help us improve our image and extend our selling season . '
23582	I 've been advising small businesses many years and have lived with the fact that 50 % will go out of business within two years , and 80 % in five years .

23601	Mr. LaBonte 's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok .
23602	The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .
23604	The changes come as Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc .
23611	A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as Reebok did , it is going to have people coming and going . ''
23613	Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp .
23615	A spokesman said that neither Mr. Fireman nor Mr. LaBonte would be available for comment .
23618	Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles .
23622	For example , Toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well , a new food and health magazine due out next summer .
23623	New York-based Hearst Corp. this fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 Months , a magazine for expectant mothers , and has already launched American Home .
23627	`` Entrepreneurs do n't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry . ''
23633	Within the same nine months , News Corp. closed down In Fashion , a once-promising young woman 's fashion magazine , Drake Publications Inc. has folded the long-troubled Venture magazine , and Lang Communications has announced Ms. magazine , after 17 years , will no longer carry advertising as of January .
23634	Lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue .
23635	Meanwhile , American Health Partners , publisher of American Health magazine , is deep in debt , and Owen Lipstein , founder and managing partner , is being forced to sell the magazine to Reader 's Digest Association Inc .
23641	`` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added .
23644	More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .
23650	`` They could be old or new , but they are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved .
23652	MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products .
23653	The price was n't disclosed , but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd. , the MCA unit , said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $ 20 million .
23654	The 40-year-old Buddy L concern , based in New York , designs and develops toys under the names `` Buddy L '' and `` My First Buddy , '' he said .
23657	FRANKLIN NATIONAL BANK DIED at 3 p.m. EDT , Oct. 8 , 1974 , and was promptly resurrected under new owners to shore up confidence in other banks during a recession .
23658	Arthur Burns , Federal Reserve Board chairman , said the government 's `` luck '' in keeping the bank open -- despite being the then-biggest U.S. bank failure -- prevented `` shock waves around the country and around the world . ''
23662	Massive withdrawals followed and there was a brief rescue attempt , with political undertones , including $ 1.77 billion in Federal Reserve loans .
23664	In June 1980 , Michele Sindona -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22 % block of Franklin 's stock from Loews Corp. , headed by Laurence A. Tisch -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury .
23667	During 1976 to 1979 , other former Franklin officials either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of violations including phony transactions to hide the bank 's losses .
23671	In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated .

23674	In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped .
23676	He heads Litigation Sciences Inc. , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate America prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions .
23677	In the process , Litigation Sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law .
23678	Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians .
23680	Among other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics .
23681	Much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving to make the desired choice .
23690	In any high-stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants .
23692	Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen .
23693	In the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict .
23694	After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity .
23695	In real life , jurors may not always work that way , but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to .
23698	But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally .
23703	`` The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University .
23704	Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
23705	The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .
23707	The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury .
23710	Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case .
23713	The problem for IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable .
23715	The solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury demographically , sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him .
23716	He then briefed Messrs. Boies and Barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly .
23718	Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences .
23720	`` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine & Moore .
23721	`` What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it .
23722	A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ''
23724	Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow .
23726	The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages .
23729	`` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . ''
23733	Theoretically , jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively .
23734	Instead , Mr. Vinson says , interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views .
23738	So would someone recently divorced or widowed .
23739	-LRB- Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . -RRB-
23741	Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women .
23742	The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books .
23747	But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ .
23749	Once a jury is selected , the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly .
23752	In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish .
23757	`` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight , '' Mr. Vinson has written .
23759	Studies show , the consultants say , that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually .
23764	Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics .
23765	`` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it , '' says Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics expert at New York University law school .
23768	Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage .
23771	A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -LRB- not at Litigation Sciences -RRB- $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine .
23773	`` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co .
23774	He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . ''
23785	-LRB- Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors . -RRB-
23788	Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors .
23789	`` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies says .
23791	One award is part of a Department of Defense contract to Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers and could be valued at more than $ 100 million over five years .
23797	In the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers , most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors : Sun Microsystems Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp. , which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs .
23800	Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than Digital , Hewlett and Sun , it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market .
23809	They , or at least something less efficient than today 's thin-walled units , may soon be making a comeback .
23811	These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol , signed by 24 nations in 1987 .
23817	CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas , often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon , which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment .
23818	Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation .
23819	Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator , which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber .
23820	But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it .
23822	Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer .
23833	It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere , the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone .
23834	But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture .
23835	The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure .
23836	What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year .
23838	Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems , running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping .
23840	Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs .
23841	Butane and propane can be used as coolants , for example , but are flammable .
23843	Mr. Teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices , energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect .
23844	Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it , but let 's not be flippant about grave risks .
23845	As it happens , Arthur D. Little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories .
23848	Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs .
23849	Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all .
23850	One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .
23852	Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it .
23853	Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course .
23855	Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it .
23856	University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . ''
23857	They needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts .
23859	That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency .
23861	Consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car .
23868	Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated .
23870	Iowa 's will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 an hour in January 1992 -- but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate .
23871	In 17 central states , one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave .
23872	The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams .
23876	Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
23882	They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave .
23883	In 1990 , the issue is expected to be especially close in Alaska , California , Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania and Illinois .
23884	`` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the Midwest and Northeast , '' says Jim Buente of the NFIB .
23887	The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller concerns .
23890	NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business .
23891	In San Francisco , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ 95 million downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business .
23894	Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area-code switch Nov. 11 -- to 708 from the familiar 312 -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers .
23895	Wessels & Pautsch , a small St. Charles law firm , plans to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers ' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards .
23896	But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out .
23900	With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts .
23904	Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ 1 million , $ 200,000 annual income , or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold .
23907	He argues California regulators historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along .
23910	A new Maryland law frees store owners of liability if a customer trips or otherwise gets hurt on the way to the restroom ... .
23911	Only 4 % of Missouri small businesses surveyed say they 've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use ... .
23912	By 52%-36 % , Tennessee NFIB members favor laws to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in the state .
23913	About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday .
23916	The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south .
23917	It will take several weeks to repair the bridge , and several months to repair some of the 101 connections .
23921	Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours , or that many workers are still staying at home .
23925	Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to BART 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn .
23927	Her commute from Petaluma , Calif. , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via the Golden Gate Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area .
23934	I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . ''
23937	`` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said Stan Perez , a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol .
23939	The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush .
23942	Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
23948	But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
23951	Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can .
23954	And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .
23959	His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. .
23961	`` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said .
23964	D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall , in the New York Academy of Art .
23965	In fact , D.T. never left home , Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link .
23966	They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov , but they put their hope in D.T. 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 .
23969	No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .
23971	But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
23973	`` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans .
23976	Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T. 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity .
23980	Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision .
23981	While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
23988	This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development .
23990	In such positions , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . ''
23993	And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
23997	Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
23998	He won D.T. 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , to give the computer much hope .
24000	And Mr. Kasparov , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room .
24011	Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
24016	The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return .
24017	More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
24018	Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value .
24019	Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
24020	The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month .
24021	Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
24023	He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds .
24029	He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch .
24030	But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks .
24034	Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . ''
24035	Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
24037	Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
24038	-LRB- Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 . -RRB-
24044	Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
24047	Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
24048	Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity .
24051	However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
24052	Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
24056	Americans are drinking less , but young professionals from Australia to West Germany are rushing to buy premium-brand American vodka , brandy and other spirits .
24057	In particular , many are snubbing the scotch preferred by their parents and opting for bourbon , the sweet firewater from the Kentucky countryside .
24060	`` Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers , '' says Michael Bellas , president of Beverage Marketing Corp. , a research and consulting firm .
24061	`` If you want to be a player , you have to be in America , Europe and the Far East .
24062	You must have world-class brands , a long-term perspective and deep pockets . ''
24064	In recent years , for example , Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain acquired Heublein Inc. , while another British company , Guinness PLC , took over United Distillers Group and Schenley Industries Inc .
24066	While premium-brand spirits like Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniel 's whiskey are riding high in the U.S. , domestic spirits consumption fell 15 % to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979 .
24070	Mexico is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S. .
24071	Japan , the world 's third-largest liquor market after the U.S. and Britain , helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products .
24072	California wineries , benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies , are expanding aggressively into Japan , as well as Canada and Great Britain .
24073	In Japan , the wineries are promoting their products ' Pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs , whose recommendations carry weight .
24074	In Australia , Britain , Canada and Greece , Brown-Forman Corp. has increased its marketing of Southern Comfort Liqueur .
24075	Using cinema , television and print ads , the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum American South .
24077	While U.S. makers of vodka , rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad , trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon .
24081	With a six-shooter in one hand and bourbon in the other .
24082	`` We imagine with bourbon the Wild West , Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing , '' says Kenji Kishimoto , vice president of Suntory International Corp. , a division of Suntory Ltd. , Japan 's largest liquor company .
24084	Bourbon makes up just 1 % of world-wide spirits consumption , but it represented 57 % of U.S. liquor exports last year , according to Jobson ; no other category had more than 19 % .
24086	Jim Beam Brands Co. , a division of American Brands Inc. , is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor .
24088	Guinness 's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout Asia , enabling it to install prominent counter displays .
24090	Bourbon exporters have succeeded in Japan where other industries have failed , avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by allying themselves with local agents .
24094	To promote Jack Daniel 's overseas , Brown-Forman uses the same photos of front porches from Lynchburg , Va. , and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops .
24097	West Germans get glitz , with bourbon in the foreground and a posh Beverly Hills hotel in the background .
24098	Ads for England are artsy and irreverent .
24102	Demand for ads also rose at the eight TV stations Capital Cities owns and at its 80%-owned ESPN sports cable channel .
24103	The broadcast and publishing company reported net climbed to $ 80.8 million , or $ 4.56 a share , from $ 62.6 million , or $ 3.55 a share , in the year-earlier period .
24108	Revenue at the broadcasting unit , consisting of the network and stations , advanced 11 % , to $ 838 million from $ 752.9 million .
24111	The parent also publishes weeklies , shopping guides and specialty magazines .
24112	For 1989 's first nine months , Capital Cities net income grew 23 % to $ 303.7 million , or $ 16.97 a share , from $ 246.9 million , or $ 14.43 a share .
24117	Nortek has agreed not to acquire any securities of Federal-Mogul for 10 years and not to influence company affairs during that period .
24120	Weyerhaeuser said its paneling business employs about 300 workers at two facilities in Chesapeake , Va. , and Hancock , Vt .
24121	Manville Corp. said it will build a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil .
24122	The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs .
24124	Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called on the Federal Reserve System to lower interest rates .
24125	In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , Mr. Kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the Fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . ''
24126	`` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said .
24131	McDonald 's Corp. said third-quarter earnings rose 14 % on a hefty sales gain , but domestic franchisees apparently did n't partake of the improvement .
24132	The world 's largest fast-food chain said net income rose to $ 217.9 million , or 59 cents a share , from $ 191.3 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago .
24147	Apparently acknowledging weaker U.S. sales systemwide , McDonald 's vowed `` to use our size and muscle to do all that is necessary to build the brand . ''
24148	Overseas , both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago .
24149	Third-quarter sales in Europe were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company 's earnings .
24154	In the nine months , earnings rose 12 % to $ 555.6 million , or $ 1.49 a share , from $ 494.4 million , or $ 1.31 a share , a year earlier .
24164	The second ship , which is half-completed , is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 .
24166	`` The others will probably be delivered as well , but Carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . ''
24182	Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year , charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs , in violation of their contract .
24185	Ms. Garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed .
24186	Eaton Corp. had a 26 % drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single business .
24187	Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer .
24189	Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago .
24195	Eaton said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million .
24196	Sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose .
24197	Eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million .
24199	The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral .
24200	Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million .
24201	The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market .
24202	For the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago .
24203	Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier .
24206	In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .
24208	The conference , held in Lower Silesia , was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Polish Ecological Club , and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry , as well as Hungarians , Czechs , Russians , Japanese and Americans .
24210	Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding Poland 's lack of functioning markets .
24212	The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation .
24215	Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions .
24217	Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
24218	Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe .
24219	Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
24221	Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
24222	They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions .
24223	The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
24230	But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year .
24232	Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance .
24234	But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects .
24246	For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose .
24248	One participant prematurely declared that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while Poland represents the opposite .
24250	At the moment , Poland resembles 19th-century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness .
24252	Mr. Levin , former head of EPA 's regulatory reform staff , adapted this from his November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association .
24253	Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of Apple Computer , Intel and many other computer-related concerns .
24254	The drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an 0.7 % slide by the Nasdaq composite index .
24258	The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2.38 to 458.32 .
24272	Other technology stocks that were weaker included Intel , which fell 1 1\/4 to 33 1\/2 on 1.9 million shares , Mentor Graphics , down 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 on 1.6 million shares , Sun Microsystems , which slipped 3\/8 to 18 1\/4 , and MCI Communications , down 1 to 42 3\/4 .
24277	SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership .
24289	He predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with `` some kind of unique product or franchise '' that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum .
24290	He puts the OTC market 's Nellcor , Office Club and BizMart on the list .
24293	Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session .
24294	Payco American , a credit collection concern , jumped 1 3\/8 to 20 5\/8 on volume of 93,000 , and Mail Boxes Etc. , a private postal services company , advanced 1\/2 to 23 1\/2 on volume of 64,000 .
24300	Amgen rose 2 1\/4 to 54 3\/4 on almost 800,000 shares , and CVB Financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares .
24301	Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
24304	And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .
24305	These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
24311	The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
24312	The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was -LRB- and is -RRB- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was -LRB- and is -RRB- regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
24314	Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
24318	The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
24319	`` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
24320	It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
24321	It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
24325	I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
24326	They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .
24329	But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
24332	If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well .
24334	Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
24340	If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
24341	There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
24342	Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
24349	Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
24350	We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
24351	Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
24358	Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .
24359	New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
24364	There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures -LRB- in real terms -RRB- have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .
24368	This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish -LRB- though that is clearly desirable -RRB- than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work .
24370	The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential .
24373	The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
24374	They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .
24375	One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods .
24376	Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson -LRB- himself a recent math major at Harvard -RRB- in the November American Spectator .
24377	-- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
24378	Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .
24380	Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .
24382	Mr. Kristol , an American Enterprise Institute fellow , co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The National Interest .
24384	The company unveiled more than 50 products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning .
24385	The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations .
24387	But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools .
24388	IBM 's announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to customers today , also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated and where Hewlett-Packard Co. has recently gained market share .
24391	He said he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology .
24395	IBM 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems .
24396	IBM can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents .
24397	`` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said George Conrades , IBM 's top marketing official .
24398	Japan 's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August .
24399	Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 .
24401	Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period .
24402	The statistics follow a year-on-year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989 , recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash .
24419	Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 .
24429	Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer .
24432	Arnold Levine , acting co-chief executive , will continue as senior vice president and a board member .
24434	In addition , a Norfolk affiliate , York Capital Inc. , will purchase all of the interests of Eagle 's secured lenders , which total $ 11.5 million , and guarantee as much as $ 8.2 million in payments to Eagle 's unsecured creditors .
24437	It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder .
24439	In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line .
24441	Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company .
24442	At the time , Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $ 8 million , and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $ 2 million .
24443	But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged .
24449	Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans .
24459	`` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ''
24460	Not including thrifts under government conservatorship , S&Ls reduced their assets by $ 10.1 billion from the previous month , and deposit outflows totaled $ 3.9 billion .
24461	For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion .
24462	Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month .
24471	If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
24472	It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System , and the informed public generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability .
24474	This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes , the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s .
24477	The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
24481	The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
24485	The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well .
24486	Independent estimates of output in those industries , including one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988 .
24487	Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year .
24489	I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
24490	Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services .
24491	In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
24495	In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20 % .
24498	Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business .
24499	Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago .
24503	`` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co .
24505	Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .
24506	Prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols , products used in making antifreeze .
24510	For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense .
24513	The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses .
24514	Propylene glycols are used in making personal-care products such as shampoo , and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products .
24517	For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago .
24519	At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders .
24521	Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico .
24524	But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri .
24527	Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
24528	These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street .
24529	Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions .
24530	Drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt .
24531	It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking .
24535	`` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
24536	The question , she said , is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . ''
24537	While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .
24543	Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million .
24549	There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
24550	Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state .
24551	New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused .
24554	State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed -LRB- Drexel -RRB- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . ''
24556	It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters .
24559	Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties .
24560	Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so .
24566	These are the 26 states , including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico , that have settled with Drexel : Alaska , Arkansas , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Utah , Vermont , Washington , Wyoming and Puerto Rico .
24567	Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 176 million , or $ 2.88 cents a share , reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3 % stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction .
24568	Separately , Warner reported a net loss of $ 106 million , or 56 cents a share , including merger expenses of $ 100 million and $ 120 million in charges associated with stock-appreciation-based compensation plans .
24570	Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow , which the company defined as earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization .
24571	On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner .
24572	Some analysts at least are buying that argument , and were n't alarmed by the losses .
24573	`` What really matters is the operating income of the divisions : I look at these numbers and I say , these businesses are doing well , '' said Mark Manson , a vice president of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
24576	Warner also had a gain of more than 13 % from records and music publishing , even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer . ''
24577	In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share .
24581	For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share .
24590	On the other hand , Time Warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division , its books division and the Home Box Office programming division .
24591	In magazines , higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines .
24592	The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ 12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO 's Comedy Channel .
24594	Robert J. Penn , president and chief executive officer , will take early retirement from this steelmaker Dec 31 .
24595	William S. Leavitt , chairman , said Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor .
24598	Mr. Leavitt , 37 , was elected chairman earlier this year by the company 's new board , having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs .
24599	His father , David S. Leavitt , was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago , at which time Mr. Penn was named president .
24601	Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp .
24602	The Oversight Board , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August , sets policy for the RTC , which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets .
24603	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board .
24604	President Bush must appoint two other members , one a Democrat and one a Republican .
24605	An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .
24607	Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review .
24608	The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years .
24611	`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said .
24613	But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking .
24614	He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's Arizona campaign committee in last year 's election , and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election .
24616	In 1986 , Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp .
24619	The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , Kweisi Mfume -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- and Paul Kanjorski -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- .
24621	Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit .
24622	Sovran also named John B. Werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial , increasing the number of corporate board members to 35 .
24623	Mr. Werner , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit .
24625	The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance .
24626	Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC .
24628	At Lloyd 's of London , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper .
24630	Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .
24633	At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business .
24635	`` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence .
24644	Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses -LRB- $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange rates -RRB- , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period .
24646	Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
24651	`` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' Betty Atkins , a secretary from suburban London , says .
24653	Ms. Atkins , who underwrote # 20,000 , or about $ 32,000 , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000 .
24654	`` If Lloyd 's wants # 70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I 've got -- and even then I do n't know if it will be enough , '' she says .
24656	`` I ca n't think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now , '' says Keith Whitten , a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979 .
24657	`` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
24660	Lloyd 's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance .
24664	Much of the business has gone to the institute , an association of more than 100 insurers , including Cigna Corp. , Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain 's Commercial Union Assurance PLC .
24666	At the peak of its power and influence a century ago , Lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a 50 % stake .
24667	It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe .
24670	Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say .
24671	Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business .
24672	Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage .
24681	`` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says .
24682	`` We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . ''
24684	By that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance .
24685	The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets .
24688	Three years ago , the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain 's Prince Charles has denounced .
24703	John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 .
24704	`` How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he says .
24711	That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
24712	But Mr. Lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be .
24713	Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses -LRB- including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo .
24717	-LRB- It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB-
24721	Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information .
24725	Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada .
24726	But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented .
24738	Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .
24744	All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. , the world 's largest , Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. , Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets .
24748	At the same time , Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors .
24758	Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing .
24759	Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled .
24761	He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
24762	Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors .
24765	In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations .
24768	Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies ' earnings .
24773	The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding .
24779	Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier .
24781	Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share .
24782	Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore .
24787	The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility .
24791	UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement .
24792	Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 .
24796	That proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands .
24799	The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . ''
24801	The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . ''
24807	In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted .
24809	As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft .
24811	The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . ''
24812	The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions .
24813	The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction .
24814	The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union .
24815	The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out .
24816	They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost .
24818	Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines .
24819	But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options .
24820	The board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer .
24822	Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value .
24824	The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees .
24831	Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
24836	Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage U.S. Memories ' failure .
24839	Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp .
24840	Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably late this week .
24843	Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week .
24849	With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service .
24851	What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
24852	Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity .
24853	But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .
24859	For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ?
24860	What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops ?
24865	The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point .
24866	`` The interpretation '' of the executive order , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . ''
24867	In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA .
24868	The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
24872	No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it .
24873	What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
24876	President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security .
24877	There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars .
24880	The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral .
24881	As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi .
24882	It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal .
24883	Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him .
24884	We 've heard California 's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years , but ABC 's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance .
24885	Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .
24888	A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here , injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the Houston Ship Channel .
24889	There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night .
24890	The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air .
24892	Glenn Cox , Phillips ' president and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions .
24897	Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control .
24898	The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school .
24900	Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise .
24901	The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said .
24902	The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts .
24905	In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house .
24906	The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene , polypropylene and K-resin , plastics used in a wide array of applications , including milk jugs and toys .
24913	U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union .
24917	Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. also reported declines in quarterly profit , while Ashland Oil Inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter .
24918	Amerada Hess Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported higher earnings .
24924	Exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ 1.11 billion , or 87 cents a share , from $ 1.22 billion , or 93 cents a share , a year earlier .
24927	Exxon 's profitability , like that of many other oil companies , was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses .
24928	Exxon 's earnings from chemicals operations fell $ 90 million , to $ 254 million , while refining and marketing profits declined $ 180 million , to $ 357 million .
24933	A year earlier , the refiner earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share .
24935	For the year , net income tumbled 61 % to $ 86 million , or $ 1.55 a share .
24941	Third-quarter earnings at Amerada Hess more than tripled to $ 51.81 million , or 64 cents a share , from $ 15.7 million , or 20 cents a share , a year earlier .
24944	Refining and marketing earnings climbed to $ 33.3 million from $ 12.9 million , and exploration and production earnings rose to $ 37.1 million from $ 17.9 million .
24949	Phillips Petroleum 's third-quarter earnings slid 60 % , to $ 87 million , or 36 cents a share , from $ 215 million , or 89 cents a share .
24951	Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline , said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement .
24952	Despite higher oil prices , exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of Phillips ' North Sea oil fields .
24955	Occidental Petroleum 's third-quarter net income rose 2.9 % to $ 108 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ 105 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .
24958	The latest period included a $ 54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties , a $ 22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental 's domestic oil and gas operations , and tax credits of $ 42 million .
24960	Occidental said oil and gas earnings fell to $ 17 million from $ 20 million .
24961	The latest period includes net gains of $ 32 million in non-recurring credits from the sale of properties , indicating operating losses for the quarter in the oil and gas division .
24964	Citing its reduced ownership in the Lyondell Petrochemical Co. , Atlantic Richfield reported that net income slid 3.1 % in the third quarter to $ 379 million , or $ 2.19 a share , from $ 391 million , or $ 2.17 a share , for the comparable period last year .
24967	Offsetting the lower stake in Lyondell were higher crude oil prices , increased natural gas volumes and higher coke prices , the company said .
24969	For the nine months , Arco reported net income of $ 1.6 billion , or $ 8.87 a share , up 33 % from $ 1.2 billion , or $ 6.56 a share a year earlier .
24972	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
24976	San Antonio , Texas -- $ 575 million of electric and gas system revenue refunding bonds , Series 1989 , 1989A and 1989B , tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group to yield from 6.15 % in 1991 to 7.30 % in 2009 .

24984	Maryland Stadium Authority -- $ 137.6 million of sports facilities lease revenue bonds , Series 1989 D , due 1992-1999 , 2004 , 2009 and 2019 , tentatively priced at par by a Morgan Stanley group to yield from 6.35 % in 1992 to 7.60 % in 2019 .

24987	The bonds are rated double-A by Moody 's and double-A-minus by S&P .
24990	The offering , Series 107 , is backed by Freddie Mac 15-year , 9 % securities , and brings Freddie Mac 's 1989 Remic issuance to $ 32.8 billion and its total volume to $ 46.8 billion since the program began in February 1988 .
24998	The three offerings together bring Fannie Mae 's 1989 Remic issuance to $ 32.4 billion and its total Remic volume to $ 44.5 billion since the program began in April 1987 .
25003	International Finance Corp . -LRB- agency -RRB- -- 10 billion pesetas of 11.6 % bonds due Nov. 30 , 1994 , priced at 101 5\/8 to yield 11.60 % less full fees , via Citibank -LRB- Madrid -RRB- and Banco Espanol de Credito , Spain .
25010	The issue is the first by Ford Motor Credit , a unit of Ford Motor Co. , and the second largest in the four-year history of the $ 45 billion asset-backed market .
25013	The offering is rated doubleA-2 by Moody 's and double-A by S&P , based on the quality of the underlying auto loans and a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from Ford Motor Credit .
25017	Morton Downey Jr. , who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests , has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the Consumer News and Business Channel , the cable channel partly owned by the General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co .
25018	The premiere of `` Showdown , '' with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter , a columnist with the New York Daily News , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m .
25020	Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive .
25028	Mr. Downey 's previous show , a one-hour shout fest , syndciated by MCA Inc. and produced by Quantum Media Inc. , was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it .
25036	Among the 30 Dow industrials , they bought McDonald 's , Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble and sold Aluminum Co. of America .
25040	`` Under this scrutiny , the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies . ''
25044	He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea , J. Baker , McDonald 's , Philip Morris and Sara Lee .
25046	McDonald 's has long-term debt equaling 91 % of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $ 2.6 billion below their real value .
25047	Coca-Cola climbed 1 3\/8 to 72 1\/8 ; McDonald 's added 1 to 31 3\/8 , and Procter & Gamble gained 3\/4 to 130 5\/8 .
25048	A&P fell 1 1\/4 to 57 5\/8 , and J. Baker gained 3\/8 to 21 1\/4 .
25052	But starting in early September , the index started to slide and now stands about even with the S&P 500 .
25055	Union Carbide , whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35 % from a year earlier and fell short of analysts ' expectations , declined 1\/2 to 24 1\/2 .
25056	Also , Exxon went down 3\/8 to 45 3\/4 and Allied-Signal lost 7\/8 to 35 1\/8 even though the companies ' results for the quarter were in line with forecasts .
25057	Other weak blue-chip issues included Chevron , which went down 2 to 64 7\/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.3 million shares ; Goodyear Tire & Rubber , off 1 1\/2 to 46 3\/4 , and American Express , down 3\/4 to 37 1\/4 .
25063	Merrill Lynch and Prudential-Bache Securities both lowered the stock 's investment rating immediately after the results were issued Friday , according to PIR .
25064	Elsewhere in the chemicals sector , Dow Chemical fell 1 1\/4 to 97 1\/2 , Monsanto lost 1 7\/8 to 118 , B.F. Goodrich slipped 2 1\/4 to 44 3\/4 and Olin slid 1 to 57 3\/4 .
25065	Other stocks hurt by earnings-related selling included Tandy , which dropped 1 3\/8 to 44 , and Eaton , which retreated 2 1\/2 to 57 1\/2 .
25068	However , Delta Air Lines fell 1 1\/2 to 67 1\/2 and USAir Group dropped 3\/4 to 42 1\/2 .
25069	Ramada gained 7\/8 to 11 1\/4 after revamping the terms of its restructuring plan , which calls for the company to sell its hotel operations for $ 540 million and spin off its casino business to shareholders .
25073	Entertainment and media stocks generally escaped the market 's slide as well .
25074	Paramount Communications rose 5\/8 to 58 3\/4 , Time Warner climbed 1 7\/8 to 138 5\/8 , Walt Disney advanced 3 1\/8 to 127 1\/2 , MCA rose 1 1\/8 to 65 5\/8 and McGraw-Hill added 1\/2 to 67 1\/8 .
25078	The company said it had been notified unofficially that Waertsilae Marine Industries , a Finnish shipyard building three cruise ships for the company , is having financial trouble and may already have filed for bankruptcy .
25079	`` Hacksaw '' and `` Bonecrusher '' are the sort of nicknames normally associated with linebackers and heavyweight contenders .
25082	At his old job in Compton , Calif. , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member .
25087	The subject of the movie `` Lean on Me , '' Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat .
25088	He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold ?
25090	Mr. Fernandez does n't take control in New York until January , but already he 's roiling the waters .
25092	It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals .
25094	One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work .
25096	Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge .
25097	We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal , toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they 're defending .
25098	In his old job , as Dade County chief , Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals .
25100	But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well ; incompetent principals and administrators should go , but the good ones ought to be left alone .
25105	Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential , but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them .
25106	The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems .
25107	The schools ' central mission , educating children , became subsumed by the competing interests of bureaucrats , politicians and unions .
25108	The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped learning .
25109	Mr. Chips was a nice fellow , and maybe some day he 'll return .
25113	Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun .
25116	Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers .
25121	Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers .
25122	David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers .
25123	Goodson said David Carr , former president of Ingersoll Publications , and Ray Cockburn , former senior vice president , would head the new in-house management team at Goodson , which had revenue of $ 225 million in 1988 .
25124	The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll .
25125	The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson .
25127	Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe .
25129	Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is `` delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship '' and will be able to `` concentrate all our energies '' on Ingersoll 's own papers .
25130	Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers .
25131	Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , Kenneth Roman , Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co .
25132	Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications .
25136	The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him .
25140	And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company .
25142	Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British .
25143	Alexander Brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations .
25145	Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP .
25148	Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
25149	He also is close to American Express 's chairman and chief executive officer , James D. Robinson III .
25150	Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson .
25152	But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine -LRB- The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client -RRB- .
25159	After talking on and off for the past four weeks , Mr. Roman said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the company in very strong hands .
25161	Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips , his successor at Ogilvy .
25164	During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes .
25166	`` I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. Sorrell -RCB- as my successor .
25168	He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut .
25169	Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units .
25171	He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives .
25173	American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency .
25174	`` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods .
25175	But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients .
25176	`` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers .
25178	I have n't seen or talked to him in several years . ''
25182	I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co .
25184	`` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
25186	`` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert .
25191	Computer Sciences would n't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting , which counsels companies on logistics and supply .
25192	But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue .
25193	Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale .
25202	Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars , including George Michael and Whitney Houston , to appear in ads for the diet drink .
25203	Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too .
25204	The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters .
25205	The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' produced by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie .
25206	Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit .
25207	In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally .
25209	`` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the U.S. , '' he said , adding that Turner Pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991 .
25210	Turner has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters .
25211	Mr. Hogan said `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming '' and `` Treasure Island '' cost more than $ 6 million each to make , which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release .
25212	The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films .
25213	In July , Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters .
25214	In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte .
25218	The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong .
25221	Those include Rhin et Moselle Vie and Via Assurances .
25224	Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral .
25226	But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend .
25233	Paribas officials , once considered France 's toughest bankers , felt abashed at Suez 's success and its rapid growth .
25237	He also told reporters the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak .
25238	Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others .
25241	Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created July 1 , which are eligible for partial dividends .
25243	Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid .
25246	Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price .
25248	When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control .
25251	France 's second-largest government-owned insurance company , Assurances Generales de France , has been building its own Navigation Mixte stake , currently thought to be between 8 % and 10 % .
25252	Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached .
25253	Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said OPEC oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter .
25262	The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products .
25274	The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in .
25284	Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments , which use both metals , showed signs of producing extra heat .
25287	Platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 .
25289	Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters .
25293	Many analysts believe that the Soviets ' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much .
25294	GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
25295	Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news .
25298	But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt .
25303	For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan .
25305	Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .
25306	But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . ''
25307	A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
25314	At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon .
25322	Ikegai-Goss , which has about 200 employees , is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology , which reduces time and materials waste when preparing a press for printing .
25323	The bond market , which sometimes thrives on bad news , cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker .
25325	Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession .
25333	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1\/2 point higher , or up about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % Friday .
25334	Municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose .
25336	In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers .
25337	In the Treasury market , analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news .
25340	We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said .
25343	So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds .
25348	The issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company .
25360	The rates were up from last week 's auction , when they were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively .
25362	Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
25366	The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 26 , 1990 .
25371	`` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said .
25373	In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors .
25377	Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 % .
25379	Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session .
25380	The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities .
25383	In the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
25384	Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 10\/32 , up 10\/32 ; and Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 1\/2 , up 1\/4 .
25387	A $ 575 million San Antonio , Texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector .
25388	The refunding issue , which had been in the wings for two months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation .
25391	He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace .
25392	In addition , he noted , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand for bonds .
25394	The issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley .
25395	Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point .
25409	`` I got to get back to school and straighten out my English . ''
25411	Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas , enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond .
25412	There have been three days of hot , wind-swept rain , and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout , which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts .
25420	The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook .
25429	Soon we have our limit of the shimmering fish stippled in rose-gold and black .
25431	The guide is young and he knows this business but he wants a different life after college , such as working for IBM and wearing a necktie .
25434	People are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves .
25435	Texas is big and beautiful and they live here , that 's all .
25439	He paid an immense fine and was lucky , according to a local wag , to escape the gas chamber .
25440	The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see .
25441	Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies .
25442	Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills .
25443	Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky-brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat .
25444	Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called Tivoli , with a white church , a gas station and a grocery , the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts .
25448	AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January .
25450	AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture .
25451	The joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks -LRB- $ 26.9 million -RRB- and 700 employees .
25452	It will develop , produce and market high-performance electronic parts .
25455	Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27 % to $ 29.6 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 40.7 million , or $ 1 a share , a year earlier .
25457	The company , which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers , said about half the earnings drop came from the `` virtual collapse '' of the Venezuelan auto industry .
25459	Dana also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier .
25464	Mr. Furuta did n't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference , but said the project would be undertaken with Ford 's European subsidiary .
25466	At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal .
25468	It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
25471	Her bare breasts , her dancing , her voice , her beauty and , perhaps most famously , her derriere , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible .
25472	Bricktop , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's . ''
25475	But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust .
25478	She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina .
25479	She made money , but spent more .
25481	Finally , Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco .
25484	African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks .
25485	To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world .
25486	Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white audiences -RRB- .
25488	`` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately .
25490	Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous .
25498	During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens .
25499	She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France .
25502	The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai deux amours '' they wept .
25503	Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II .
25504	In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested .
25508	One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond .
25509	In `` Josephine Baker '' -LRB- Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 -RRB- , which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month , Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star .
25510	The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw .
25513	Manville , having rid itself of asbestos , now sells fiberglass , forest products , minerals and industrial goods .
25515	But Manville 's ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors .
25518	When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash .
25523	What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares . ''
25526	Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 .
25532	And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
25535	It does n't pay a dividend , and this trust needs income .
25543	And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name .
25549	Analysts predict little or no near-term growth .
25552	And he says Manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other construction-related firms are hurting and selling cheap .
25553	With a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1-to-1 -- and $ 329 million in cash -- Manville is indeed actively on the prowl .
25556	And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80 % of its stock in friendly hands , Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul .

25565	Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. said the Federal Trade Commission has requested additional information from the two companies about their announced intention to acquire Vermont American Corp. for $ 40 a share , or about $ 440 million .
25567	The FTC 's request was `` not unusual '' and Emerson will make a `` full and prompt '' response , according to a spokesman .
25568	Spokesmen for Emerson and Vermont American , which has agreed to be acquired , said they do n't anticipate `` any problems '' with the completion of the transaction .
25569	An FTC spokesman said the matter is `` in a non-public posture at this time '' and declined to comment further .
25570	Emerson and Bosch , through their joint acquisition arm , Maple Acquisition , have begun a cash tender offer for all of Vermont 's common shares outstanding .
25571	The offer , set to expire Nov. 1 , may be extended pending the timing and resolution of the FTC request , the companies said .
25572	St. Louis-based Emerson and Stuttgart-based Bosch make electrical and electronic products , including power tools .
25579	Santa Fe Pacific Realty is a major California land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the San Francisco Bay area , and several office sites .
25581	As a result of the partial sale and spinoff , the $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation , according to officials of the fund , who described the plan .
25583	Also holding two seats each on the board , they said , would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada , and Itel Corp. , controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell .
25584	The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs .
25585	Itel bought a 17 % stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20 % stake ; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific .
25586	The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate .
25591	In addition , pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns .
25603	The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors , among other possibilities .
25606	It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area .
25608	The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments .
25609	The fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year .
25610	Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific , but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago .
25613	After two mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman , James T. Sherwin , have changed considerably .
25615	In an eight-count indictment , the government charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , chemical maker , and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986 .
25616	The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin , takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian .
25617	The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government 's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian .
25620	The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document .
25621	After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on March 22 .
25622	Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June .
25626	The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo .
25627	For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count .
25629	Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September , defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended .
25630	There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman .
25637	Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $ 2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan .
25639	It also bars future suits against Robins company officials , members of the Robins family and Robins 's former insurer , Aetna Life & Casualty Co .
25642	The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries .
25645	In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants .
25646	The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 .
25649	Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case .
25650	Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time .
25660	Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act .
25664	The key issue in the case , which the law firm is handling without a fee , or pro bono , is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review .
25667	Wilmer Cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing .
25668	P.J. Mode , Wilmer Cutler 's managing partner , says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised .
25669	The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also , because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work .
25673	James Burke and Larry Evans , formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery , and Prudence Clark , a Barclay sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs .
25675	Henry Pitman , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million .
25676	Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales , they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali , who died in January .
25678	Westamerica Bancorp. said Richard W. Decker resigned as president and chief executive officer after only a year on the job because of `` differences '' with the board .
25680	It did n't specify the nature of the differences , saying only that they related to `` management style '' and `` strategic objectives . ''
25683	Neither Mr. Payne nor Mr. Decker could be reached to comment .
25684	Westamerica has about $ 1.3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern California .
25689	When he was hired , Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker 's `` extraordinary ... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as one of the West 's brightest bankers . ''
25691	For the six months ended June 30 , it earned $ 3.1 million , or 61 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 2.4 million , or 41 cents a share , a year earlier .
25693	Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in California in 1991 , and larger California banks , such as Wells Fargo & Co. , have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray .
25695	Varian Associates Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif. , reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95 % to $ 1 million , or five cents a share , from $ 24.2 million , or $ 1.10 a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
25697	For the full fiscal year , Varian posted a 13 % profit rise to $ 31.5 million , or $ 1.53 a share , up from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.27 a share , last year .
25699	A profit last year in both the quarter and year included a net gain of $ 9.6 million , or 44 cents a share , from the sale of a division .
25700	Additionally , the full-year profit last year reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $ 22.8 million , or $ 1.04 a share .
25702	Sales rose 18 % in the fiscal fourth quarter to $ 364.1 million from $ 307.9 million on the strength in semiconductors and other products .
25703	In a last-ditch effort to keep its sales force and customer base , Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed in principle to transfer ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary to two of its top executives .
25710	In the transaction , Integrated will transfer 100 % ownership of the subsidiary to Gerard M. Lavin , executive vice president of Integrated and head of back-office operations at the subsidiary , and Gary W. Krat , executive vice president of the parent and president of the subsidiary .
25712	In an interview , Mr. Krat said that based on criteria yet to be determined , he expects to distribute 49 % of Royal Alliance to the representatives , who sell Integrated 's insurance and mutual-fund products .
25714	Mr. Krat indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks , and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if Integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime .
25719	`` I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive , '' said Stephen D. Weinroth , chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated .
25726	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8578 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , down from 142.43 yen late Friday .
25730	The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong .
25732	Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to come .
25738	They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum .
25745	Traders , however , are quick to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for buying dollars , the U.S. unit has found a `` natural bottom '' at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen .
25750	Liz Claiborne Inc. , New York , said its third-quarter net income jumped 62 % , citing continued strength in apparel sales and the start of shipments of its new product lines : a men 's fragrance , large-size women 's apparel and casual knitwear .
25751	The big apparel maker and retailer said that its net income in the latest quarter increased to $ 51.1 million , or 58 cents a share , from $ 31.7 million , or 36 cents a share , a year earlier .
25755	For the nine months , net income rose 48 % to $ 124.2 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 83.8 million , or 96 cents a share a year earlier .
25769	But institutional investors may wait a little longer to appraise the direction of the U.S. monetary policy and the dollar , traders said .
25771	He said investors were picking individual stocks based on specific incentives and the likelihood of a wider price increase over the short term .
25772	The selective approach blurred themes such as domestic-demand issues , large-capitalization issues or high-technology shares , which had been providing at least some trading direction over the past few weeks , Mr. Wada said .
25773	Investors took profits on major construction shares , which advanced last week , shifting their attention to some midsize companies such as Aoki Corp. , Tobishima and Maeda .
25776	Teijin was up 15 at 936 , and Kyowa Hakko gained 30 to 1,770 .
25782	Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities .
25783	They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August .
25784	`` It 's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell , '' a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said .
25790	Dealers , however , said forecasts are broadly divergent with estimates ranging between # 1 billion and # 2 billion .
25791	`` The range of expectations is so broad , '' a dealer at another major U.K. brokerage firm said , `` the deficit may have to be nearer or above # 2 billion for it to have any impact on the market . ''
25792	Lucas Industries , a British automotive and aerospace concern , rose 13 pence to 614 pence after it said its pretax profit for the year rose 28 % .
25797	But there was little selling pressure , and even small orders at the lower levels sufficed to bring the market back to Friday 's opening levels .
25799	The market is still 4 % short of its level before the plunge , and analysts are n't sure how long it will take until the DAX has closed that gap .
25801	Banking stocks were the major gainers Monday amid hope that interest rates have peaked , as Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank added 4 marks each to 664 marks -LRB- $ 357 -RRB- and 326 marks , respectively .
25803	Auto shares were mixed , as Daimler-Benz firmed 2 to 723 , Bayerische Motoren Werke lost the same amount to 554 , and Volkswagen inched down 1.4 to 451.6 .

25891	The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies .
25893	That suit and Exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage .
25895	Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion .
25897	Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct .
25902	Since the spill last March , Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage .
25903	Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill .
25906	Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway .
25909	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Meson said it holds 67,400 Verit common shares , including net purchases of 8,100 shares bought from Oct. 10 , 1988 , to Oct. 11 , 1989 , for $ 3.875 to $ 7 each .
25914	The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $ 2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
25915	The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration , but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $ 1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds .
25916	By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- and his party 's largest state delegation in the House .
25918	`` We are the Golden State , '' Mr. Fazio said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . ''
25919	The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
25921	The measure is expected to come before the House today , and Congress is under pressure to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow , when the current continuing resolution expires .
25922	Given California 's size and political importance , the White House is eager to appear generous .
25924	A White House budget office analysis estimates that $ 500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California 's needs , and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration .
25925	`` Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we 've got to address it , '' said Mr. Darman , who came to the Capitol to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session .
25926	`` I would hope very much that we would n't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat . ''
25928	A master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $ 2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative .
25930	On the chairman 's motion , the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it .
25932	Mr. Whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months .
25933	A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator , Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by California 's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel .
25934	The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands , and lumber interests sought to add another $ 100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina .
25940	However , Raymond C. Kurzweil , chairman and chief executive , said `` The company continues to require additional funding to realize the potential of its technology . ''
25947	Amtech , which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace , defense , computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas , said its final audited results are due in late November .

25985	CMS Enhancements Inc. said it estimates that sales and earnings for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 fell somewhat from the year-earlier period .
25986	Jim Farooquee , chief executive officer of the Tustin , Calif. , computer accessories supplier , said he was `` comfortable '' with analysts ' expectations that CMS would earn between six cents and eight cents a share on revenue of about $ 42 million .
25987	A year earlier , CMS posted profit of $ 1.1 million , or 13 cents a share , on sales of $ 48 million .
25991	It said it will buy back two million shares , or 18.4 % , of the total outstanding , and continue operations buying and managing real estate .
25992	Property Capital , which is based in Boston , had told shareholders it expected to distribute at least $ 21 a share , or $ 229 million , in a liquidation , based on an expected asset sale price of $ 290 million or more .
25994	As a result of dropping the liquidation plan , shareholders will have to treat dividends received this year as ordinary income or capital gains rather than as tax free returns of capital , the company said .
25996	A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year .
25997	Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million .
25999	The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding .
26001	For the nine months , the company had net income of $ 15.1 million , or 74 cents a share , up 98 % from $ 7.6 million , or 38 cents a share last year .
26004	The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards , and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations .
26005	United Education & Software , a Los Angeles education services company , called the commission 's action `` precipitous and unwarranted . ''
26007	United Education & Software posted a $ 250,000 bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in guaranteeing any more loans for National Technical Schools students prior to the hearing .
26008	A decline in Allied-Signal Inc. 's automotive business contributed to flat sales and only slightly higher earnings in the third quarter .
26009	Allied-Signal reported that net rose 1.7 % to $ 121 million , or 81 cents a share , from $ 119 million , or 80 cents a share , the year earlier .
26011	For the nine months , the Morris Township , N.J.-based company , with businesses in aerospace , automotive products and engineered materials , earned $ 413 million , or $ 2.77 cents a share , up 15 % from $ 359 million , or $ 2.40 a share .
26013	Chairman Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said that a drop in sales of auto and truck parts contributed to lower earnings in the automotive unit .
26014	He also cited unfavorable foreign-exchange rates and a lower tax rate .
26016	Earnings at Allied-Signal 's aerospace business rose to $ 55 million from $ 41 million a year ago , primarily on higher sales and profit in its engines and auxiliary power units .
26019	The regulations , required under legislation enacted by Congress last year , will apply to imports of vehicles that were n't built to meet U.S. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in Europe or elsewhere abroad .
26021	According to the NHTSA , the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the U.S. government , or a person who has a contract with a registered importer , from permanently importing a vehicle that does n't meet the U.S. auto safety standards .
26022	The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the U.S. safety standards , compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the U.S. standards .
26023	Congress tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after U.S. auto dealers , including franchised foreign-car dealers , complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars could n't meet U.S. auto safety standards .
26024	Legent Corp. said it expects to report net income between $ 6.4 million and $ 6.9 million , or between 32 cents and 34 cents a share , for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
26025	In the year-ago quarter , the software developer reported pro forma earnings of $ 4.8 million , or 24 cents a share .
26027	For the fiscal year , the company said it anticipates reporting earnings of $ 23 million , or about $ 1.15 a share , including a charge of about $ 5.9 million , or 22 cents a share , related to the merger that created Legent out of Duquesne Systems Inc. and Morino Inc. in March 1989 .
26029	Pro forma earnings for fiscal 1988 were $ 19.6 million , or 99 cents a share , on revenue of $ 97.2 million .
26031	Archive Corp. said it expects to report net income for its fiscal year ended Sept. 29 of a record $ 15 million , or $ 1.15 a share , up 43 % from $ 10.5 million , or 80 cents a share , for the prior year .
26033	Archive attributed the gains to strong demand for its products , continued growth of the reseller market and the acquisition of Maynard Electronics in February , which accounted for about 14 % of the company 's revenue .
26037	Detrex is setting aside $ 3.1 million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $ 1.9 million because of tax considerations .

26042	Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units .
26043	First Executive said the offering will raise about $ 299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business .
26045	Each of the units consists of two warrants , each of which could be used to purchase a half-share of common stock , and one depositary preference share .

26085	The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants .
26088	The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said .
26089	The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law .
26090	Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise .
26091	The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers .
26092	They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged .
26097	Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez .
26101	Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate , where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , Charles Keating Jr. , principal stockholder of Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. of Phoenix , Ariz .
26103	Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers .
26110	In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal , for example , Rep. Thomas Lantos , the California Democrat who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato , a New York Republican .
26113	Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open .
26116	As the principal regulator of the thrift industry , Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly .
26117	Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca .
26120	`` I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness , and by God I 'm not going to tolerate it , '' he says .
26121	Mr. Wall , however , is a self-proclaimed `` child of the Senate '' and former staff director of its Banking Committee .
26122	An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others , Sens. Dennis DeConcini -LRB- D. , Ariz. -RRB- , John McCain -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- , John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- and Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich . -RRB- .
26126	`` When I first got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this , '' says Michael Waldman , director of Congress Watch , a consumer group .
26130	Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix , and the California thrift 's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan .
26132	`` He 's wise , he 's good and I know he 's an honest man , '' the Texan says .
26134	The Senate negotiators included Sens. Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall 's principal sponsor , Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah .
26135	They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall 's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L .
26141	Mr. Keating raised $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering .
26143	But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others .
26144	Rep. Jim Leach -LRB- R. , Iowa -RRB- says the Lincoln S&L affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds : `` The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making . ''
26147	`` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone interview yesterday .
26148	But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions .
26150	He has characterized the five senators ' roles as `` tantamount to an attempt to subvert the ... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting .
26153	When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago , they started life in Los Angeles with only $ 400 .
26154	They 'd actually left the Soviet Union with $ 480 , but during a stop in Italy Ms. Volokh dropped $ 80 on a black velvet suit .
26160	Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981 , when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $ 10 million .
26162	Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News , the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair 's gossipy archness and Premiere 's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae , with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter .
26163	It 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores .
26164	Though Ms. Volokh is a small woman , she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in Hollywood .
26165	Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev , when she lived with her parents , her husband and her two sons in a 2 1\/2-room apartment in what she calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape .
26167	However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban 10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel .
26173	I used to wear hats in Russia , but I had to make them and my dresses .
26176	At Movieline , she wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek . ''
26177	In restaurants -LRB- in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres -RRB- , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room .
26178	`` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you turn it off ? ''
26179	That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties .
26180	`` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik -LRB- `` a little well done , but very good '' -RRB- .
26184	As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies , Ms. Volokh sees her party-giving as an important part of business .
26185	She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings .
26189	`` It 's supposed to be later but I just moved it .
26191	She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . ''
26192	Guests bring movies on tape , and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs ' art-nouveau library -LRB- `` the pleasure dome '' -RRB- .
26193	They eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain their clips .
26194	`` It 's very revealing and soul baring , '' said Ms. Volokh .
26195	The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs , Boris Krutchensky -LRB- who has the title of co-publisher -RRB- , and Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co-editor .
26204	Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` The Art of Russian Cuisine , '' brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co .
26206	`` Look at Dostoevski and Kafka .
26207	No one ever eats in their books and look at them ... .
26210	In life , she offers practical dieting advice : `` Divide your meals into important and unimportant .
26213	Amusing as she is , and frivolous as she can seem , this is a serious person with some difficult memories .
26219	One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . ''
26220	By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R .
26224	Mr. Volokh was fired from his job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities .
26225	The Volokhs were afraid that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk .
26227	Their visa came in relatively short order , and they moved to Los Angeles .
26228	Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field , but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation - as translator for a Russian who spoke fluent English .
26233	When her husband and son founded their computer company , Vesoft , she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist .
26236	`` You never know if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one .
26238	William D. Forrester , president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council , has a warning for U.S. companies trying to do business in the Soviet Union .
26239	`` It 's an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , '' Mr. Forrester says .
26241	Undeterred by such words of caution , corporate America is flocking to Moscow , lured by a huge untapped market and Mikhail Gorbachev 's attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy .
26242	Doing business with the Russians , once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans , has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp. , Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. , as well as a cluster of smaller firms .
26244	But while U.S. interest may be big and growing , the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating .
26245	Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy , Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika , the restructuring of the Soviet economy .
26248	And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics .
26252	Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
26253	The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists , and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped .
26257	The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures , behind West Germany , Finland and Italy .
26263	Both Colgate and Procter & Gamble have received big orders for toothpaste , soap and detergents .
26267	Because the Soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars , marks and other Western currencies , companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction .
26269	Shelley M. Zeiger , an entrepreneur from New Jersey who buys Soviet porcelain and `` matryoshka '' nesting dolls for export to the U.S. , says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items .
26270	Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project .
26271	Several medical concerns , including Pfizer Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach .
26276	It will be financed by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English-language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements .
26283	Cray Research Inc. said it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems , the Cray Y-MP\/832 , to the United Kingdom Meteorological Office .
26284	The system is the first to be sold through the joint marketing agreement between Cray and Control Data Corp .
26287	The move will give Nuovo Banco a badly needed foreign presence , and make Credit Agricole the bank 's largest shareholder .
26298	Since then , the bank has strengthened its Italian network , and has posted strong results .
26301	A company spokeswoman said the company had n't decided what measures to take , but did n't rule out legal action .
26305	Qintex Australia Ltd. , a media and resorts concern controlled by Australian entrepreneur Christopher Skase , announced a plan to restructure and sell assets to try to ease its financial problems .
26306	Mr. Skase , a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company , said in a statement that Qintex will sell its 51 % stake in its upscale Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii as well as three Australian television stations .
26308	Qintex Australia has n't disclosed its borrowings , but analysts estimate the company 's debt at A$ 1.2 billion .
26310	He said the move will `` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , '' but he did n't provide details of the merger .
26311	Company officials said over the weekend that Qintex Australia 's bank creditors have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the company , including a failed US$ 1.5 billion plan to buy MGM\/UA Communications Co. , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , movie and television production concern .
26313	Analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in Qintex Australia and force it to sell assets .
26314	The company 's latest moves were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment .
26315	Mr. Skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry .
26319	In March , Qintex sold 49 % of the three Mirage resorts to Japan 's Nippon Shinpan Co. and Mitsui & Co. for A$ 433 million .
26325	They were what he called an `` unlawful termination '' by MGM\/UA of the acquisition agreement with Qintex , high Australian interest rates , a pilots ' strike at Australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company 's Australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional TV stations in Queensland state .
26326	MGM\/UA has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and Qintex Australia has threatened a countersuit .
26328	In his statement , Mr. Skase said preliminary accounts showed that group profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed A$ 170 million . ''
26331	The company will make `` adequate provisions '' to cover costs of the dispute with MGM\/UA and any loss from the investment in Qintex Entertainment , he said .
26334	Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services .
26340	National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them .
26344	The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives .
26346	National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a 4-kilobit memory , next year .
26353	Witnesses often must travel long distances to give face-to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters .
26355	And telephone or videotape depositions just do n't match physical encounters .
26356	That could change , thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics .
26359	And it is preparing to set up shop in Chicago , New York and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network .
26360	While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper .
26361	An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities .

26372	Hitachi charges Motorola `` has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents '' used in Motorola 's MC68030 microprocessor chip .
26373	Translation : Motorola appears to have taken a Hitachi technology that is patented in the U.S. , Hitachi says , and `` tried to make it look like a new technology . ''
26374	Motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges .

26377	They mimic the brain by `` looking '' at an image , extracting the fundamentals -- boundaries , corners and lines -- and translating them into computer data .
26378	Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features ... .
26382	The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders .
26384	Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier .
26385	The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income .
26390	He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack . ''
26393	Tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64 a share , in the year ended June 30 .
26394	Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market .
26395	Tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines .
26396	Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter .
26403	And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve .
26404	Amid the market disorder , even Drexel , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns .
26405	Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors .
26407	`` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over , '' says Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company .
26412	Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale .
26413	At that point , the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell .
26415	`` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says .
26416	`` Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . ''
26417	What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds .
26418	Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs .
26419	At closely held Deltec Securities Corp. , junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise .
26422	Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said .
26423	Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress .
26424	And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .
26425	`` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .
26426	Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
26427	Meanwhile , Prudential , the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds , has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ 6.5 billion from $ 7 billion since August because of falling junk prices .
26428	`` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says James A. Gregoire , a managing director .
26429	`` I have no reason to think things will get worse , but this market has a knack for surprising us .
26441	These bonds , now rated single-D , include junk offerings by AP Industries , Columbia Savings -LRB- Colorado -RRB- , First Texas Savings Association , Gilbraltar Financial Corp. , Integrated Resources Inc. , Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. , Resorts International Inc. , Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc .
26443	Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds .
26444	Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . ''
26446	During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps .
26448	Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include Resorts International , Braniff , Integrated Resources , SCI TV , Gillette Holdings , Western Electric and Southmark .
26453	As it turns out , the board has a lot of important members , including Winton Blount -LRB- former postmaster general of the U.S. -RRB- , Mrs. Henry Gaisman -LRB- widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor -RRB- and Vincent Murphy -LRB- an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co . -RRB-
26455	`` Helen Boehm has a way with names , '' says James Revson , a gossip columnist for Newsday -LRB- and son of Joseph Revson , a founder of Revlon -RRB- .
26456	Like which are droppable and which are not .
26457	With the fall social season well under way , name-droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers .
26458	But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids .
26460	`` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .
26462	It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . ''
26464	`` I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks .
26465	I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was Liza .
26473	`` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , '' he says .
26475	`` I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , '' says Steven Greenberg , publisher of Fame .
26477	And Beauregard was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing . ''
26478	Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes , publisher of Forbes magazine -LRB- `` We've been in the columns together '' -RRB- , Mary Boone , a New York art dealer -LRB- `` I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure '' -RRB- and Bridget Fonda , the actress -LRB- `` She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends '' -RRB- .
26480	These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher .
26481	`` They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' says Mr. Revson .
26484	In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer .
26486	It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant .
26489	Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall .
26491	In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous .
26492	`` Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , '' says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real-estate agency .
26496	`` If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , '' says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains .
26497	Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers .
26500	He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis .
26502	`` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler says .
26504	Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud .
26505	`` Get caught and you 're dead in the water , '' says Mr. Thal .
26507	If directors or producers phone me and say they know ` Liz , ' I know they 've never met her .
26509	In New York society , Pat Buckley , the very social wife of author William Buckley , has the nicknames `` Mrs. Buckles '' and `` Patsy . ''
26511	`` But call her ` Patty , ' and it 's a sure giveaway you 're not in her circle , because she does n't use that name , '' says Joan Kron , editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine , a monthly publication sent to all the right names .
26516	Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean .
26521	The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway , stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles Atlanta to the `` Big Chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark .
26524	Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet , Ford and Dodge are nameplates that did n't exist until three years ago : Acura , Sterling , Hyundai .
26528	Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from just 408 when the decade began , according to Automotive News , a trade publication .
26530	For American car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing .
26532	He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today , and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image .
26533	`` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . ''
26535	He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines .
26537	`` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp .
26540	She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car .
26541	Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time .
26543	Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago .
26544	The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . ''
26545	Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
26546	Just four years ago , GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments .
26547	Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .
26548	The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here .
26549	For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in .
26551	GM launched the Geo marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and next year GM 's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut .
26556	For the survey , Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits .
26558	It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor .
26559	Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do .
26560	Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car , compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over , according to the Journal survey .
26563	That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older .
26564	Generally , imports appeal most to Americans who live in the West and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young .
26566	Such preferences persist even though many Americans believe differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing .
26573	`` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip .
26577	Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side .
26581	Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
26584	In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal .
26588	Americans spent more than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last year , and just 1 % of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion .
26591	The workers install , maintain and repair its private branch exchanges , which are large intracompany telephone networks .
26594	Days later , the thieves returned and dug out more , this time adding insult to injury .
26597	Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds .
26598	Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year , it 's a pricey lawn decoration : A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $ 1,000 , and taller ones often fetch $ 3,000 or more .
26599	`` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' says Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum .
26602	Police suspect that the criminals , who dig up the plants in the dead of night , are selling them to nurseries or landscapers .
26605	The department is advising residents to plant Sagos , if they must , in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off .
26607	After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove , `` I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain , '' he says proudly .
26615	The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .
26616	The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage , in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits .
26618	Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September , but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage .
26622	Behind second-place Morgan Stanley were Kidder , Peabody & Co. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston Inc. 's First Boston Corp. unit .
26623	A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , First Executive Corp. and others , charging them with artificially inflating Imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors .
26624	The complaint , filed in federal district court , accuses Imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data .
26625	It also charges that Imperial , the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan , experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages .
26627	Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities .
26629	Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems .
26631	Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit .
26632	In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here , shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial , its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company 's assets .
26635	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
26636	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
26639	Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , said it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group .
26640	Rhone-Poulenc , a chemical and pharmaceutical company , said RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $ 900 million .
26642	Consumer spending in Britain rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago , the Central Statistical Office estimated Friday .
26643	A group including Gene E. Phillips , former chairman of Southmark Corp. , and William S. Friedman , former vice chairman of Southmark , lowered its stake in the Dallas real estate concern to 7.7 % , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
26651	Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition .
26654	Kodak says its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video .
26655	Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers .
26657	It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
26658	The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says Joerg D. Agin , vice president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division .
26659	Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years .
26663	Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations .
26664	`` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice president - engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios .
26671	But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed .
26672	Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for another five to 10 years , and will probably retail for more than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars .
26678	And as it unfolds , it 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society .
26679	Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month .
26680	But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone .
26681	`` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst .
26687	Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders .
26688	Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe .
26689	Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan .
26690	To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory .
26691	Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
26692	Devotees pass hours , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with their thoughts .
26693	At 500 yen -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II .
26694	But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen -LRB- almost $ 92 billion -RRB- , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry .
26699	The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral .
26701	The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren .
26702	The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report .
26703	And at first , neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue .
26708	The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .
26711	Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .
26713	The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese .
26714	That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society .
26715	Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support .
26717	But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally .
26719	Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending .
26722	Afterwards , I went home and practiced for three hours . ''
26724	At 31 , Mr. McDuffie has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule .
26725	He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia , with stops including Charleston , S.C . -LRB- Oct. 25 -RRB- , Sarasota , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 28 -RRB- , Tampa , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 29 -RRB- and Miami -LRB- Oct. 31 -RRB- .

26729	His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition .
26730	`` I thought I was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls Mr. McDuffie , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl .
26735	After studies at that conservatory 's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian , he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay , Mr. Galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival .
26741	As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' ''
26742	The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself .
26744	`` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ?
26748	It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber .
26751	`` He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score .
26754	It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it that way , kind of gigue-like .
26761	Since leaving Juilliard , Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
26763	By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which he recently recorded for Angel\/EMI along with Leonard Bernstein 's engaging `` Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion . ''
26764	Mr. McDuffie 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works .
26767	But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani .
26768	At Avery Fisher Hall here , Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- Bruch 's overwrought `` Violin Concerto in G Minor . ''
26769	His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed .
26777	A lot of observers think so , and , if they 're right , the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt .
26778	A sudden , forced cutback by consumers , who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity , would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments ca n't readily take up the slack .
26781	During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion , inflation-adjusted gross national product , disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30 % , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66 % .
26784	In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco , Mr. Durkin comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences . ''
26790	The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income , though up a bit , has n't climbed steeply , and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed .
26793	In addition , he says , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . ''
26795	Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . ''
26799	A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .
26800	In fact , the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly .
26804	Consumers , credit cards in hand , are n't running amok through the shopping malls -- or putting the economy at any great risk .
26805	Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public .
26806	The 67-year-old maker of brassieres , panties , and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images , but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family .
26811	Maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics .
26813	Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons .
26815	Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I ... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman .
26817	`` Capitalizing on the brand is key , '' says Mr. Brawer , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S. .
26818	`` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- Maidenform -RCB- is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York .
26820	Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising .
26821	Three days later , Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co. , a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc .
26826	The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people .
26829	`` You ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights .
26835	It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc. , the intimate apparel division , and Playtex Family Products Corp. , which makes tampons , hair-care items and other products .
26836	Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel .
26837	Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent , says Executive Vice President David C. Masket , but they are n't taken very seriously .
26840	`` Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales , '' says Deborah Bronston , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst .
26841	Mr. Brawer , along with Mrs. Coleman and her daughter , Elizabeth , an attorney who is vice chairman , are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform , which employs about 5,000 .
26842	Mr. Brawer 's wife , Catherine , and Robert Stroup , Elizabeth 's husband , round out the five-member board .
26848	While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , Ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters .
26850	The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S. , Puerto Rico , other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland .
26851	Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores , but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in Omaha , Neb. , and has 24 factory outlets , with plans to add more .
26855	While the company has always been family-run , Mr. Brawer is n't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform .
26856	Mrs. Coleman 's husband , Joseph , a physician , succeeded Mrs. Rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 .
26858	According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 .
26862	According to Chinese customs figures , import growth has slowed in recent months , dropping to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August from the year-earlier periods , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
26866	China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline , when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency .
26870	Because of this and the huge trade gap , the deficit in China 's current account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is expected to widen sharply from the $ 3.8 billion deficit last year .
26872	In one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25 % and 5 % recorded during the first seven months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion .
26875	In this case , China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $ 8.7 billion , based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20 % and exports 10 % .
26879	In addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China 's deteriorating political and economic environment .
26882	The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment .
26883	In the second , foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10 % and investment to drop 10 % .
26885	In the first scenario , the reserves would be exhausted next year , and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991 .
26886	Roche Holding AG , parent of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said its group sales rose 22 % in the first nine months of the year to 7.32 billion francs -LRB- $ 4.51 billion -RRB- .
26891	Carr-Lowrey , a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and toiletries industries , had sales last year of about $ 40 million .
26894	At 18,000 feet , he says , he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land .
26896	But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time .
26897	Had he been a little less gung-ho , `` I 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar , '' Mr. Brown says .
26899	Federal 's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock .
26905	It has also rattled Federal 's strongly anti-union management , which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits .
26906	`` A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory , '' Frederick W. Smith , Federal 's chairman and chief executive , says with disdain .
26910	Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers .
26912	`` Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company , '' says Bernard La Londe , a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant .
26920	He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats .
26930	Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean .
26935	UPS wo n't discuss its labor practices , but , according to Mr. Cleveland , a former UPS employee , and others , union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans .
26936	Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot , say these couriers , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late .
26939	It more than doubled Federal 's long-term debt to $ 1.9 billion , thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four .
26944	These and other problems squeezed Federal 's profit margins last year to 8 % , down from more than 13 % annually in the first half of the decade .
26946	In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says .
26952	In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations .
26954	Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually .
26955	Analysts expect Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 , when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger 's extra flights , back-up planes and landing rights .
26958	Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination .
26959	When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority .
26963	Soon after the merger , moreover , Federal 's management asked Tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time , without cause or notice .
26966	In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options .
26969	And even some pro-union pilots say his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat .
26970	`` A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith , '' says J.X. Gollich , a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist .
26971	Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles , Ohio , New York , Alaska , Asia and Europe .
26980	Meanwhile , the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists , and that is costing Federal `` a big number , '' says James Barksdale , executive vice president and chief operating officer .
26982	`` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran .
26983	Adds John Poag , a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board : `` They 've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots , and for us , nothing . ''
26987	The fight has turned ugly and , among pilots at least , has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build .
26991	Barney Barnhardt , a 727 captain and leader of the pro-union forces , said he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague .
26992	`` The pilots are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh .
26993	Harsco Corp. said it obtained a $ 33.1 million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment .
26995	The company said it received an order for 23 of the vehicles , which retrieve tanks and other heavy-tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged , and an option for 16 more .
26997	Harsco produces products for defense , industrial , commercial and construction markets .
26999	Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him .
27002	With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
27007	Instead , they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust , irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases .
27008	Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber .
27012	Mr. Hastings was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country .
27014	Following the impeachment conviction , Dr. Benjamin Hooks , executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , issued a restrained statement , warning that the Hastings case could set a `` dangerous precedent , '' but adding , `` We must respect the considered judgment of the Senate .
27015	When last we left him , FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a Washington political scandal , and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` Favorite Son . ''
27018	There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup :
27021	A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards .
27023	Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' -LRB- NBC , Fridays , 10 p.m . ET -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI .
27024	Over the first few weeks , `` Mancuso FBI '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack of imagination , or both .
27029	Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -LRB- Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young boss -LRB- Fredric Lehne -RRB- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB- Lindsay Frost -RRB- , and a forensics expert -LRB- Charles Siebert -RRB- .
27032	-LRB- In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -RRB-
27038	Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover , and two cleaned his house . ''
27043	Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the American Way .
27047	Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner -LRB- and writer\/producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello -RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point .
27048	To start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` What if the press gets a hold of this ? ''
27050	At least once Mancuso 's boss yells `` In here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his investigator down :
27052	One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . ''
27053	Finally , of course , the boss gives in , but he 's still yelling : `` I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy , you 'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage . ''
27054	In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches .
27055	Witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : `` ... a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice . ''
27058	You built your career on prejudice and hate .
27062	You 're the real criminal here ... and what you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . ''
27065	They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it .
27067	It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz .
27072	Asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk , but he 's too choked up to get the words out .
27073	He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
27074	It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and Robert Loggia 's acting resonated in the silence .
27077	With a Twist of the Wrist Boys with tops , and Frisbee tossers , And P.R. types with bees in their bonnet , Have a goal in common , all of them try To put the right spin on it .
27087	Tana , which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south Texas , will provide Texaco with mostly gas reserves .
27088	The fields contain recoverable reserves of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil .
27092	They were either too small or uneconomic to maintain , the company said .
27094	Texaco acquired Tana before it completed those sales because Tana 's properties are high quality and near other fields Texaco already owns , a company spokeswoman said .
27095	Texaco , like many other oil companies , has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves .
27096	Texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its brawl with Pennzoil and then on New York investor Carl C. Icahn 's attempt to take over the company .
27099	Mr. Icahn , who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company , sold his stake in Texaco just last summer .
27101	CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 .
27104	H&R BLOCK Inc. had net income of $ 100.2 million , or $ 1.90 a share , in the fiscal year ended April 30 .
27117	The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie . Financiere de Suez , the acquisitive French financial conglomerate .
27121	Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars .
27122	In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks .
27123	In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
27126	Aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions , Mr. Lippens has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them , Axa-Midi , Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez , all based in France .
27127	They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG , '' he said .
27129	A `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares .
27130	Aside from Generale de Belgique and Asahi , the syndicate includes Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas , a Belgian savings bank , and various family interests .
27135	With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ?
27136	President Bush 's national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft , came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration .
27138	He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term .
27139	So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out .
27140	The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency .
27141	However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues .
27142	During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
27144	Gen. Scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds .
27146	`` The problem with this administration , I think , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the NSC . ''
27147	The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies .
27148	By law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense .
27149	In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .
27150	But the size , shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide .
27155	He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration 's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua 's Contra rebels .
27157	Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates , are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs .
27158	Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society .
27160	But neither has an extensive background in Latin America , the Middle East or Asia .
27162	Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus .
27163	But just as every previous NSC adviser has , Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained .
27164	Japan 's wholesale prices in the first 10 days of October fell 0.3 % from the previous 10 days but rose 3.3 % from a year ago , the Bank of Japan said .
27166	A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive , admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s .
27168	Mr. Tomlin , who left the Navy in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges .
27169	The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria , Va .
27172	Mr. Tomlin , among other things , illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said .
27174	Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained `` approval of the scheme '' from more-senior Sperry officials `` because the payment which -LCB- Mr . -RCB- Tomlin requested was so large . ''
27175	Charles Gardner , a former Unisys vice president , and James Neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes .
27177	Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine .
27179	Seats are quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked .
27183	He plugged the contest on Larry King 's radio show , on Pat Sajak 's television show and on the C-SPAN cable television network .
27184	He talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how-to advice on using government information for fun and profit .
27187	And in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` My Favorite Bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners-up $ 500 .
27189	To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss .
27203	Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return .
27206	Saab said last week it `` has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . ''
27208	Ford and Saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both parties . ''
27209	Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology .
27210	Ford originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U.S. luxury car markets .
27211	In addition , Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations .
27218	Saab and Fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab 's 9000 model , Fiat 's Croma and Lancia 's Thema .
27227	But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S. .
27230	About 5.4 million Jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on London 's stock exchange Friday , and Jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- .
27234	Up in his stadium box , their new and controversial owner , Jerral `` Jerry '' Jones , watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line .
27239	With three minutes left on the clock , Mr. Aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back .
27243	For Mr. Jones , losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys -- and , this year , much of the National Football League .
27244	Once fat and happy , the Cowboys now are losing games , fans and money .
27249	Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr. Aikman .
27250	Last year , the top 12 players on each NFL team took home an average $ 536,000 , a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball .
27251	First-round draft picks have done even better : Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987 .
27253	`` One team pays so much and the other pays more .
27256	Owners , largely complacent in the past , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue -- embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process .
27258	Shortly after buying 66 % of the team from H.R. `` Bum '' Bright for $ 145 million , and mindful of the Cowboys ' ragged bottom line , the 47-year-old Mr. Jones set about his own round of team cuts .
27259	First , he unceremoniously sacked Tom Landry , the legendary coach who took the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons .
27263	He quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and , in July , announced plans to sell Valley Ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL .
27265	It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era .
27266	He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help .
27275	Football has long been Mr. Jones 's passion , both on and off the field .
27277	After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers .
27278	Years later , with cash from the sale of the insurance company , he founded Arkoma Production Corp. , an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock .
27280	He tapped Jimmy Johnson , a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami , where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987 .
27281	Whatever Mr. Johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans , he is no Tom Landry .
27286	He continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks .
27288	But the general trend , given rising costs in the league , has been to raise prices , and Mr. Jones is expected to eventually follow suit .
27289	`` It 's simple , '' says Lamar Hunt , who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ 2.40 to an average $ 17 .
27292	The suites are air-conditioned , have wet bars and plush seating , and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $ 475,000 to $ 1 million , depending on their size and location .
27293	Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players , and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time .
27299	The team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights .
27302	Mr. Jones , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16-hour days , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days .
27303	He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his part in the bidding wars .
27306	Soon , only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams , predicts John J. Veatch Jr. , an investment banker with Salomon Brothers who handled the Cowboys sale .
27308	Details of the plan , which would go into effect in 1993 , are sketchy , but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability .
27309	Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance .
27310	The NFL Players Association , meanwhile , contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans , and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management , not players ' salaries .
27312	Many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts .
27313	Most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old .
27315	`` We have the worst lease in the NFL , '' contends Michael B. McCaskey , the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas , who founded the NFL 's predecessor organization .
27316	`` We 're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated . ''
27325	The new breed of team owner , Mr. Jones included , has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock .
27330	For his part , Jerry Jones says he 's in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that .
27331	He puts in busy six-day weeks -LRB- excluding game days -RRB- , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a TV producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters .
27338	There is the new private jet , the platoon of assistants , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as `` Prime Time Live . ''
27346	Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ?
27350	It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are .
27351	This film did emphasize how long the Israeli\/Palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done .
27352	Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning .
27360	Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict .
27361	If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts .
27367	Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
27369	Under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled .
27372	Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed .
27375	A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .
27376	The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee .
27377	Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies .
27378	However , he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans .
27384	`` The proposal , while well-intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' Michael Raoul-Duval , managing director of First Boston , said in an interview .
27386	Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible .
27387	An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . ''
27388	Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC 's goals . ''
27389	Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
27391	I 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists .
27392	In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government .
27393	Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort .
27396	Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
27397	In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest .
27398	It is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. Asman 's opinions of their country .
27399	The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba .
27401	Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people .
27403	It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -LRB- as we well know -RRB- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy .
27408	From my own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel , we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these days .
27414	Investors bailed out of New York City bonds in droves last week , driving prices lower and boosting yields .
27416	While that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding , Friday 's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors .
27418	`` Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . ''
27419	Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty .
27420	A spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before the November mayoral election .
27421	-LRB- General obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit . -RRB-
27428	Rumors persisted last week that New York 's credit ratings -- single-A from Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus from Standard & Poor 's Corp. -- are at risk .
27431	Mr. Regan warned mayoral candidates `` to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the New York City economy . ''
27436	There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis .
27440	`` The market can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people wild , '' said Bernard B. Beal , chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market .
27447	Qintex Entertainment also said David Evans , its president and chief executive , and Roger Kimmel , a director , both resigned .
27449	Earlier this month , Qintex Australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire MGM\/UA Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction .
27451	Qintex Entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of `` The New Leave It to Beaver Show . ''
27452	Qintex Entertainment is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and said it relies on the Australian company for funding its working capital requirements .
27455	Jonathan Lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment , said Qintex Entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with MCA .
27456	The $ 5.9 million payment was due Oct. 1 and the deadline for default was Oct. 19 .
27462	Mr. Lloyd said both Qintex Entertainment and Qintex Australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ 5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on Oct. 14 .
27464	However a Qintex Australia spokesman said his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment .
27465	In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . ''
27468	The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned Hollywood executives and investors .
27470	Qintex Australia was `` going to pay more than $ 1 billion for MGM\/UA and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ 5.9 million . ''
27471	Qintex said Mr. Evans , the former president , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that Mr. Kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying MGM\/UA was no longer necessary .
27472	Mr. Kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980 .
27473	The announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between Qintex Australia and MGM\/UA might be revived .
27476	It is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , '' said Barry Diller , chairman and chief executive officer of the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp .
27477	Financial printer Bowne & Co. said it formed a business translation service , which will provide legal , financial and other services in most major languages , including Japanese , Chinese and Russian .
27482	The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets .
27483	A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another .
27485	The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . ''
27486	He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry .
27489	`` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -LCB- UAL -RCB- deal , '' he said .
27495	Still , Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks .
27496	All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position .
27502	Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats .
27508	Flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas .
27510	France 's national tobacco company , known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises and Gitanes , is branching out .
27512	Brown tobacco in France is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde tobacco , used in so-called American-style cigarettes .
27514	He says that because Seita 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done .
27521	When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later .
27523	Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service .
27525	It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary , Belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA .
27527	And it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops .
27530	While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand .
27531	So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes .
27532	The aim , says Mr. de Galle , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying French .
27533	When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions last July , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds .
27535	The decision , Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services , illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices .
27537	The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution .
27543	Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . ''
27547	`` The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters .
27550	There 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day . ''
27554	In Missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension .
27555	A Boone County judge rejected the motion , but Daniel Dodson , a Jefferson City lawyer , says he has appealed .
27556	And in a case filed in federal court in August , a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery .
27559	The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill .
27560	Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years .
27562	In the port of Berbera , for example , hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever .
27566	What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa .
27572	Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . ''
27573	The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
27574	That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world .
27575	In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control .
27577	But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway .
27578	On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas .
27579	Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops .
27581	Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa , threatening the town of Dese , which would cut off Mr. Mengistu 's capital from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa .
27587	The U.S. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa .
27590	What 's more , the U.S. has suspended $ 2.5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid .
27593	Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand .
27596	Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be .
27598	While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia , it should continue to back former President Carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan .
27599	Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa .
27600	Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 .
27602	But the U.S. has one great advantage : The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all .
27603	It 's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side , but on the horn of Africa as well .
27604	The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre , and that should be cut fast .
27605	Mr. Kaplan , author of `` Surrender or Starve : The Wars Behind the Famine '' -LRB- Westview Press , 1988 -RRB- , lives in Lisbon .
27612	McCormick is a developer and manager of futures-investment limited partnerships .
27613	Through a separate agreement between Peter Dauchy , president , and a group of selling shareholders , the company said , Mr. Dauchy will on Oct. 30 buy 231,405 shares from the group , boosting his stake to about 717,000 shares , or 50.7 % of the total after the buy-back .
27615	The rise followed boosts of 0.1 % in August , 0.7 % in July and 0.6 % in June .
27617	Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out .
27618	But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters .
27621	So far this year , rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others .
27623	OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune .
27631	Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market .
27632	The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market .
27633	However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member .
27635	`` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi .
27640	Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling .
27645	But the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting .
27647	The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others .
27651	In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million .
27658	In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century .
27668	The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs .
27674	Even modernized , he said , the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers France has sent to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf .
27675	Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .
27679	The bureau cited typhoons in the month that discouraged shopping and leisure opportunities .
27685	The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year .
27687	Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing .
27690	There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC .
27692	Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar .
27694	Ms. Hall expects Cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next .
27700	The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay 's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America .
27703	Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada .
27707	Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged .
27711	But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade .
27716	In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier .
27717	`` We 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' Mr. Eddington says .
27718	`` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
27719	We 'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok , Singapore and Manila . ''
27721	Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam .
27729	`` Cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . ''
27730	Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
27731	`` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
27733	Falcon , a limited partnership , said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $ 2.15-per-unit annual payment , and for expansion and acquisitions .
27736	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
27766	In the hard-hit Marina neighborhood , life after the earthquake is often all too real , but sometimes surreal .
27767	Some scenes : -- Saturday morning , a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life 's possessions .
27770	A couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by , headphones jauntily in place , weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses .
27775	She bursts into tears and walks away .
27776	Nearby , five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools , having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses .
27778	In addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs .
27779	The cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast , and for dinner , pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along with the salmon .
27781	She and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and `` aroma therapy '' -- massages with scented oils .
27782	She finds the response of Marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes `` incredible .
27791	Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness .
27798	Some residents defied orders and returned to `` red '' buildings to retrieve goods .
27799	One building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out , and a resident who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend , telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby .
27804	The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake .
27806	The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals .
27807	The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish .
27809	`` She can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , '' says Daralee Konowitch , animalcare services manager for the SPCA .
27811	The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit .
27812	But turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb .
27813	Only it is safer , and busier .
27814	Over the past year there have been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981 .
27815	A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies .
27818	A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability .
27819	Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
27822	This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible .
27823	The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment .
27825	This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
27828	And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like .
27829	Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60 % of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects .
27831	What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields . ''
27832	Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women .
27833	In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago 's Third Ward , opposite the Robert Taylor Homes , 29 % of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14 % to members of other minority groups .
27836	Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess .
27838	One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing .
27839	Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them .
27840	Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive .
27842	Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance .
27843	Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard .
27847	Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center .
27849	These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax-free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing .
27850	Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
27851	However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions .
27852	Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities .
27853	These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it .
27854	Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
27856	New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets .
27857	If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .
27858	Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves .
27862	For each $ 1,000 of notes , the maker of specialty metals , industrial fasteners and consumer products will pay $ 1,026.46 plus $ 8.68 of interest accrued from Dec. 1 .
27865	One company recently was listed on the New York Stock Exchange , and another will join the Big Board from the over-the-counter market this week .
27875	Separately , on the Pacific Stock Exchange , put and call options on the common stock of Aldus Corp. started trading .
27877	Options give a holder the right , but not the obligation , to buy or sell a security at a set price within a set period of time .
27883	Dow said it already has agreements with Albert J. Smith Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of PSE , and certain other officers of the company under which Dow may buy about 40 % of the PSE common shares outstanding .
27884	PSE is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $ 234 million .
27885	The company is owner and operator , or an equity partner , in six cogeneration facilities -- two in Texas and four in California .
27886	The company said recently it expects third-quarter earnings will be in range from $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share , compared with $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , a year ago .
27888	Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks .
27890	Growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on Oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements .
27892	`` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares Mary Farrell , a PaineWebber analyst .
27893	Among her OTC picks are Oshkosh B'Gosh and A&W Brands .
27898	That 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks .
27899	`` You can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says John Palicka , chief portfolio manager at Midco Investors , a Newark , N.J. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes .
27900	Mr. Palicka 's picks from the OTC market include Legent , Mail Boxes Etc. , and Payco American .
27904	In anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now .
27907	Smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % .
27908	In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year .
27909	Also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips .
27910	As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % .
27911	The Nasdaq Composite has gained 23 % this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 % .
27914	Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell .
27916	Mark Schoeppner , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support . ''
27921	The medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 .
27938	The company 's shares began trading at 12 1\/2 , up from its initial offering price of 12 , and closed at 13 .
27943	A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has asked that Medstone perform more studies on its device to treat gallstones .
27944	Qintex Entertainment dropped 2 5\/8 to 1 1\/2 after seeking protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code for itself and its two operating subsidiaries , Hal Roach Studios and Qintex Productions .
27945	Raymond Corp. lost 1 to 10 after it said late Thursday that it will take a $ 4.4 million charge in its third quarter for reserves to cover potential charges in connection with the closing and sale of a manufacturing plant .
27947	McCaw Cellular Communications and its target , LIN Broadcasting , were active .
27948	LIN added 5\/8 to 110 5\/8 and McCaw lost 1\/4 to 41 .
27952	Apple earned $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share , in the quarter , including $ 48 million from the sale of its Adobe Systems stock .
27953	The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
27958	The equity kicker is not attached to the offering , but underwriters said it will be offered after a filing for 68,548 common shares of CNW Holdings is declared effective by the Securities & Exchange Commission .
27959	The issue is noncallable for five years and has a sinking fund starting in 2000 to retire 50 % of the issue before maturity .
27960	Rated single-B-2 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-B-minus by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
27963	For bankers and regulators , Arizona is looking more like Texas every day .
27967	It charged off an estimated $ 200 million of Arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate .
27969	The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter , and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard .
27970	Earlier last week , Valley National Corp. , the state 's largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend .
27971	Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about Pinnacle 's moribund Merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
27974	Furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind First Interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it .
27979	He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . ''
27981	At least six of Arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses .
27987	Together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion .
27988	They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up .
27991	All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking .
27992	In the late 1970s and early 1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that Arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4 % to 6 % for years to come .
27993	Now , annual population growth is running at about 2 % a year , some desert tracts bought three years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are being sold at $ 25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space .
27994	`` It 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in Phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings , '' said C.W. Jackson , a prominent Arizona businessman with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses .
27997	That 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : So far this month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day .
27999	Moreover , Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures .
28000	And the generally frail condition of Arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide .
28001	`` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. Jackson .
28002	`` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end ... .
28004	First Interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its Texas operations .
28005	For the six months ended June 30 , it reported net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a share , including $ 46 million from tax credits and accounting changes .
28009	First Interstate said its operations outside of Arizona `` achieved results as expected for the quarter , '' but did n't specify the results .
28011	Since its unsuccessful bid for BankAmerica Corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in California in 1991 .
28014	S&P also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit , Valley National Bank of Arizona .
28017	Commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds , he said , and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days .
28018	Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
28020	IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
28022	But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
28024	The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering .
28025	Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents .
28027	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
28028	Heller Financial Inc. , an indirect subsidiary of Fuji Bank Ltd. , shelf offering of up to $ 1 billion debt securities and warrants .
28029	Jason Overseas Ltd. , proposed offering of five million common shares , via Smith Barney & Co. and Mabon Nugent & Co .
28030	MCI Communications Corp. , shelf offering of up to $ 750 million of debt securities via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , and Salomon Brothers Inc .
28035	It said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72 % to $ 11.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 6.8 million , or 19 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
28037	For the nine months , the San Jose , Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents a share .
28039	Analysts expect Conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ 40 million , or $ 1 to $ 1.05 a share , on sales of $ 650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business .
28043	Since its inception , Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines .
28045	The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems , the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops , and to Toshiba Corp. , NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp. , the leading Japanese laptop makers .
28046	`` They 've had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they 've been greatly rewarded , '' said Bob Katsive , an analyst at Disk\/Trend Inc. , a market researcher in Los Altos , Calif .
28051	Both Toshiba and NEC already produce hard-disk drives , and Sony also is studying the field , Mr. Claridge said .
28054	Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces .
28055	`` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our -LRB- older -RRB- products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name .
28061	Conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase .
28062	From its inception , Conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as Seagate .
28064	Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to Compaq , which as of July owned 40 % of Conner 's stock .
28070	He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees .
28078	In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers .
28080	If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. Cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm .
28082	So far , says Mr. Cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions .
28083	The firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes .
28086	A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- and his wife , Jane Lee Garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman .
28094	`` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. Garcia , 56 years old .
28096	The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities .
28100	The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti .
28104	He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm .
28105	Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community .
28111	Illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the American Bar Association .
28119	Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon .
28121	Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
28123	Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account .
28125	Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined to comment .
28127	Also mentioned as a contender was TBWA Advertising , but the company denied it was participating .
28131	But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million .
28136	That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing .
28140	Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business .
28142	While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million Polo\/Ralph Lauren business .
28143	Its victories include more than $ 30 million in Sheraton Corp. business and an assignment from Dun & Bradstreet worth $ 5 million to $ 10 million .
28152	Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley .
28153	For the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored between the East Bay and San Francisco .
28154	The Red and White Fleet , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip .
28161	Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants .
28163	`` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said Scott Shafer , a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos .
28178	California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans .
28179	The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year .
28180	Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief .
28182	G. Christian Hill and Ken Wells contributed to this article .
28188	Bond Corp. has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property .
28189	Much of Bond Corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of Bond Corp. 's assets and those of its units .
28190	The results included a A$ 453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$ 149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20 % in Lonrho PLC .
28191	However , Bond Corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later .
28192	Earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived 50 % to A$ 123.8 million from A$ 247.3 million .
28193	The company said the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations , G. Heileman Brewing Co. , was `` disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results . ''
28195	The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for Alan Bond and his flagship , Bond Corp .
28198	It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block .
28201	But we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business .
28202	Bond Corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses .
28203	It said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios .
28204	The result `` will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , '' Bond Corp. directors said in a statement .
28205	Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm .
28207	Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . ''
28210	The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
28213	The owner was Israel Ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two .
28216	The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged .
28219	For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service .
28221	Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year .
28222	The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople .
28223	Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers .
28228	It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses .
28229	The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job .
28231	Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving .
28232	More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises .
28233	In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year .
28242	One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises .
28245	Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
28246	This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York .
28250	Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places .
28256	The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents .
28263	For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
28265	With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
28268	It might even have saved the life , and business , of Israel Ortiz .
28269	Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington , D.C .
28273	The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital .
28277	They will have to revisit this issue , and they 'll have to revisit it before long .
28279	That 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's Friday-the-13th plunge .
28281	That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday , last Monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed .
28283	Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds .
28285	`` That means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . ''
28290	What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform ? ''
28293	Gold-oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1.15 % .
28294	Flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at about half the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of 1.27 % , according to Lipper .
28310	By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , Monetta was 55 % in cash , said Robert Bacarella , president and portfolio manager .
28312	Among Mr. Bacarella 's picks : Oracle Systems , Reebok International Ltd. and Digital Microwave Corp .
28314	Among the big stock funds , Dreyfus Fund , with more than $ 2 billion in assets , had a decline of just 1.49 % for the week and a return of 21.42 % for the year .
28315	Howard Stein , chairman of Dreyfus Corp. , said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13 , and about 10 % in cash .
28318	We believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . ''
28320	From its high point on Thursday , Oct. 12 , to where it traded late in New York a week later , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen .
28321	Three International Cash Portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week .
28326	Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for National Aviation & Technology .
28329	There 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness . ''
28334	`` People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . ''
28339	Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC , a major British composite insurer , said it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society 's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe .
28340	Officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that GRE will hold in Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents .
28341	But the companies said that Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents will market GRE life insurance , pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the U.K .
28343	Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant , architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting .
28347	You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air .
28349	Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which comes from endangered rain forests .
28350	He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of Paul Stuart , the Madison Avenue clothing store .
28351	He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space .
28352	He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts .
28360	If Mr. McDonough 's plans get executed , as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from Warsaw 's abundant rubble .
28364	The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes .
28365	To the extent that the $ 150 million budget will allow it , Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , to limit the emission of formaldehyde .
28370	Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . ''
28372	The son of a Seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before entering Dartmouth College .
28375	He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland .
28376	Living in Hong Kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies .
28377	At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers .
28378	He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont .
28381	The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big , operable windows .
28384	Jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked-down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic .
28388	Economists and administrators sit along a `` boulevard '' with street lamps and ficus trees .
28392	It `` really looks beautiful and is very light , '' says Ann Hornaday , a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings .
28395	Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough 's environmental concern .
28397	It makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors .
28398	To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at Paul Stuart , however , Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country .
28401	He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center .
28402	The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in Poland now , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe .
28403	Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the `` Eiffel Tower of Warsaw '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of Poland . ''
28406	The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages .
28408	Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained .
28411	Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations .
28412	Net sank to $ 3.1 million , or eight cents a share , including $ 789,000 , or two cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
28413	In the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
28415	Pittston also owns Brink 's Inc. , the security service , and Burlington Air Express , the air-freight concern .
28420	While `` the tone '' of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound , seasonal factors are likely to hinder Burlington Air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter , Pittston said .
28421	Brink 's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures .
28424	As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani are in trouble .
28425	Mr. Dinkins , the Manhattan borough president , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls .
28426	But , in the past 10 days , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become New York 's first black mayor .
28430	This is the nation 's biggest city and , traditionally , its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician .
28432	Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star .
28434	`` Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy , '' says David Garth , veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for Mayor Edward Koch , defeated by Mr. Dinkins in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary .
28436	`` I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for Dinkins , '' says Richard Wade , a politically active professor who supported Richard Ravitch , an also-ran in the Democratic primary .
28441	For , just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes 's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday .
28442	To help out this week , the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD 's Jack Kemp , Transportation 's Samuel Skinner and Treasury 's Nicholas Brady , according to Peter Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager .
28445	But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past .
28448	`` People were n't so happy in the 1930s , '' says Thomas Lessner , another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia , the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition Mr. Giuliani hopes to emulate .
28450	The 62-year-old Mr. Dinkins , an ex-Marine , has served as the city clerk and as Manhattan borough president , a job with limited executive responsibilities
28452	He defeated the contentious Mr. Koch in the Democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city 's racial and ethnic wounds .
28453	His general-election campaign is almost Reagan-like , all muted pictures and comforting words .
28455	Both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but Mr. Dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them .
28463	On the other , he seeks to convince voters he 's the new Fiorello LaGuardia -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead New York out of the mess it 's in .
28464	It has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties -LRB- he won the Liberal endorsement -RRB- and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters .
28467	Mr. Dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble .
28475	It began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years .
28477	And now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. , headed by his old friend and patron , Percy Sutton , to his son , David Dinkins Jr. , for $ 58,000 .
28485	`` It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' value of the shares and their market value . ''
28486	So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded .
28489	He evades and ducks .
28490	He 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . ''
28494	Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi , the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London 's Blackfriar 's Bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse .
28496	Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the Vatican bank .
28498	Italian news reports said Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official , Pavel Hnilica .
28499	Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione , channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland .
28500	Neither Mr. Hnilica , Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend .
28501	This business trust company said its board elected Kieran E. Burke , a consultant to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. , as chief executive officer , a new post , and as president .
28504	The company also named Michael E. Gellert , a director and a major shareholder , to fill the vacant seat of chairman .
28509	The Serious Fraud Office , a division of London 's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes , said its work would take in `` allegations of fraud prior to , surrounding and subsequent to the merger . ''
28510	Ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will `` cooperate fully . ''
28512	The British defense electronics group has said it will sell # 100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles .
28513	Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team , but not as principal owners .
28515	Comsat Video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team .
28517	Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise .
28520	Comsat Video , which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms , plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings , as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams .
28521	Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets ' day-today affairs .
28522	Royal Business Group Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging Realist Inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws `` by engaging in a scheme to prevent '' Royal from acquiring Realist .
28523	Royal , which makes and distributes business forms , owns an 8 % stake in Realist .
28525	Royal 's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was `` designed to entrench management and thwart Royal 's offer . ''
28526	Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist , a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , for $ 14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase .
28528	A Realist official said the company had n't yet received the full complaint and would n't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it .
28529	Winnebago Industries Inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half .
28530	The Forest City , Iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug. 26 .
28531	A year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share .
28533	Indeed , Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter .
28534	The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions .
28538	The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .
28540	`` So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases . ''
28544	Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in August , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year .
28545	The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things .
28547	The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson , Winnebago 's founder and chairman .
28549	For the year , Winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
28552	As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative .
28559	But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled .
28561	For example , a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and -0.06 % in the third quarter .
28563	Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins .
28564	Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed .
28566	Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh .
28567	`` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . ''
28573	Mr. Kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term Treasurys .
28574	He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities .
28575	`` If the -LCB- Tennessee Valley Authority -RCB- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said .
28576	TVA , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week .
28580	Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction .
28582	Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
28589	When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage point more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond .
28596	Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline .
28599	Also providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks .
28601	Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as 1\/4 point , or about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
28608	However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done .
28619	The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
28623	That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house .
28624	Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold .
28625	The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
28628	The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , Better Book Inc .
28629	The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 .
28631	The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale .
28632	The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book .
28635	Morgan Guaranty Trust , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank , an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said .
28636	Further , McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks .
28637	Morgan , Toronto-Dominion and Provident are leading that syndicate .
28638	McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in McCaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern .
28641	Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution .
28644	Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations .
28645	The Communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world .
28646	Japan agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory , a spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said .
28650	`` In some places the stonework is so damaged it shows signs of breaking off , '' scientists and technicians said in a report to Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini .
28652	East Germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices .
28653	Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted ; but to reduce it further , he said , production and supply of other beverages , including fruit juices , should be stepped up .
28654	He added that shops will have to continue reducing their stocks of liquor and avoid displaying them too prominently in the window .
28656	The center , close to Hong Kong 's border with China , will be ready today and will be able to house 1,000 inmates , Police Deputy Director Peter Wong said .
28663	Instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , Japanese banking officials said .
28664	The plan , proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans .
28671	The Soviet newspaper Trud reported that Mickey Mouse will appear in a Russian-language comic book to be issued four times a year by Soviet publisher Fizkultura i Sport and Denmark 's Gutenberghus Group .
28673	Ekco Group Inc. , Nashua , N.H. , expects to report that net income in the third quarter , ended Oct. 1 , fell 50 % to 60 % from $ 2.1 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
28674	Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility .
28676	But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a share , in 1988 .
28678	In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share .
28680	The year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's Woodstream Corp. unit , acquired last January , but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 .
28682	Mr. Stein said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in September but have been ordering more heavily in October .
28683	Mr. Stein said Woodstream is `` marginally profitable '' but has n't performed as well as expected .
28684	Woodstream 's Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said .
28685	But the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering from a `` depressed market , '' and Ekco is seeking to sell that segment , he said .
28687	-LRB- Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . -RRB-
28688	Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit .
28691	Ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at factories in the U.S. and Canada .
28695	He indicated that Ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ 75 million to $ 100 million , partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , suppliers .
28697	The imposition of austerity measures , starting last October , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter .
28698	Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects .
28699	And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash .
28700	Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems .
28705	At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months .
28707	He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million .
28708	The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest .
28710	`` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist .
28713	The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
28715	In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback .
28717	Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
28724	In recent weeks , China 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities .
28725	The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
28730	`` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office .
28733	Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties .
28737	Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say .
28739	Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer .
28743	Foreign traders also say many of China 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit .
28745	`` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says .
28746	Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years .
28748	Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics .
28749	These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly .
28750	But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices .
28752	Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock .
28758	The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills .
28759	On July 2 , 1987 , the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet .
28760	Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $ 104.8 million .
28761	Defendants include British Petroleum America ; Trinidad Corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund .
28762	The fund was created by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $ 14 million in damages .
28764	The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief .
28767	It claims the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages .
28769	The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , a sponsor of the bill .
28772	RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class .
28773	Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school .
28774	`` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course .
28776	But these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes .
28778	Students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect .
28780	At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course .
28781	Partners lecture on how to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers .
28785	The building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , '' says Edmund Edelman , chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors .
28787	There will be recreation and movie rooms .
28790	And there will be a nurse 's station and rooms for children to meet with social workers .
28792	The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals .
28795	About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month .
28800	Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years .
28801	Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend over half their time supervising their firms ' day-to-day operations and just a little more than a third of their time practicing law .
28803	Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
28804	The sweeping measure incorporates $ 500 million in small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway-construction funds and $ 1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
28807	The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration .
28808	`` We will support it , we will thank him , and we will augment it where appropriate , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .
28809	Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments .
28810	`` Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , '' the legislation reads , and the new obligations `` shall not be a charge against the Budget Act , Gramm-Rudman-Hollings , or other ceilings .
28813	We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . ''
28815	Moody 's said it also lowered the ratings of $ 70 million of Pinnacle 's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2 , and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa .

28819	Then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s .
28822	Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing .
28823	Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' -LRB- North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it .
28824	Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .
28826	Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .
28827	After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . ''
28828	But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
28829	They seem to be having the `` worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit . ''
28830	It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do .
28832	Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold .
28833	While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom .
28834	In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
28835	The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere .
28836	The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty .
28837	In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters .
28840	In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction .
28841	`` Rascal Money '' -LRB- Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world .
28842	Patrician , dynamic Scott Thatcher , founder and head of PegaSys , initially finds the takeover threat risible .
28843	But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal .
28844	Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel .
28845	And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out .
28847	Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions .
28848	Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process .
28854	Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick .
28857	Two other firms , Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays .
28859	Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade .
28860	Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment .
28861	But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .
28864	The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized .
28869	The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending .
28870	The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion .
28873	But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
28875	The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .
28878	He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers .
28882	`` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .
28884	HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
28885	The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks .
28886	The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
28887	`` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues Jack Clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation .
28888	`` The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . ''
28890	Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial .
28891	They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department 's concern over their future .
28892	They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and Toshiba , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs .
28894	Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free .
28895	`` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says .
28897	Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5 % stake in the company .
28899	SHV , of the Netherlands , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah .
28900	Burmah said it had n't held any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation .

28916	Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March , and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts .
28918	However , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials .
28920	Arizona Instrument Corp. said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $ 600,000 , or 25 cents to 27 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 214,000 , or 10 cents a share , a year earlier .
28922	For the nine months , the company expects to post a net loss of about $ 879,000 , or 35 cents to 40 cents a share , on revenue of $ 6.5 million .
28923	A year earlier , it had a loss of $ 199,203 or nine cents a share , on revenue of $ 7.6 million .
28925	At least , that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers .
28928	The upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty 50 '' companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin .
28932	The question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains .
28935	Growth stocks may be as big as Philip Morris or medium-sized such as Circuit City Stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15 % to 20 % a year , money managers say .
28936	`` The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , '' says Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income Fund .
28937	Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading .
28938	This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds John Calverley , senior economist for American Express Bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known as the `` nifty 50 . ''
28941	He also thinks foreign investors , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices .
28945	Mr. Sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years .
28949	He recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as Philip Morris , PepsiCo , CPC International , Reebok International , and Limited Inc .
28951	Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle .
28953	James Wright , chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . ''
28954	He recently trimmed his portfolio of International Paper , Dow Chemical , Quantum Chemical , International Business Machines and Digital Equipment .
28955	He is putting money in Dress Barn , Circuit City Stores , Bruno 's , and Rubbermaid .
28957	He cites IBM , which reported a 30 % earnings decline in the third quarter , and which last week announced a $ 1 billion buy-back of its shares .
28961	But not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals .
28967	Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks .
28970	But block trading desks and money managers made a concerted effort to meet the imbalances with stock to sell , one trader said .
28971	As a result , the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted in narrow ranges in the final hour of trading , and closed 5.94 higher to 2689.14 .
28974	For the week , the industrial average gained 119.88 points , or 4.7 % , the biggest weekly point advance ever and a better than 50 % rebound from the 190.58 point loss the industrial average logged Oct. 13 .
28976	Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index gained 0.03 to 347.16 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.02 to 325.50 , and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.05 to 192.12 .
28977	Most of last week 's surge in the industrial average came on Monday , when the average rose 88.12 points as market players snapped up blue-chip issues and shunned the broad market .
28979	The S&P 500 rose 4 % , the Dow Jones Equity Market index gained 3.7 % and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 3.5 % .
28987	Unocal fell 1 1\/2 to 52 1\/4 and Burlington Resources declined 7\/8 to 45 5\/8 .

28990	Paper and forest-products stocks declined after Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. lowered investment ratings on a number of issues in the two sectors , based on a forecast that pulp prices will fall sharply .
28991	International Paper dropped 5\/8 to 51 , Georgia-Pacific fell 1 3\/4 to 56 1\/4 , Stone Container tumbled 1 1\/2 to 26 5\/8 , Great Northern Nekoosa went down 5\/8 to 38 3\/8 and Weyerhaeuser lost 7\/8 to 28 1\/8 .
28993	Merrill Lynch cut its rating and 1990 earnings estimate Thursday , citing weakness in its credit-rating business .

28998	Stoneridge Resources Inc. said it will begin an offering of rights equivalent to 2.6 million common shares and valued at $ 22,750,000 .

29031	MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp. said it filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for issuance of as much as $ 750 million of debt securities .
29032	The debt will include medium-term notes sold through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ; Goldman , Sachs & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc .
29033	The funds will be used for refinancing existing debt of the Washington , D.C. , concern at lower interest rates and for other general purposes .
29035	A group including ESL Partners Ltd. , a Fort Worth , Texas , investment partnership , and Richard E. Rainwater , a former adviser to the Fort Worth Bass family , said it reduced its stake in Anacomp Inc. to 3.6 % of the common shares outstanding .
29036	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group said it sold 1,325,900 Anacomp common shares from Aug. 31 to last Wednesday for $ 4.48 to $ 5.84 a share , resulting in a drop in its holdings to 1,351,662 shares .
29040	It said then it had had and would continue to have discussions with Anacomp 's management concerning its investment .
29042	The life-insurance holding company said the sale would result in an after-tax gain of about $ 32 million , or $ 3.09 a share , in the first quarter of
29044	The change will result in a charge of about $ 8.5 million , or 82 cents a share , because of an increase in deferred income-tax liability .

29056	A shareholder filed suit , seeking to block Unitel Video Inc. 's proposed plan to be acquired by a new affiliate of closely held Kenmare Capital Corp. for $ 15 a share , or $ 33.6 million .
29058	The complaint alleges that the price is `` unfair and grossly inadequate '' and that the defendants are seeking to ensure a `` lockup '' of the purchase of Unitel , thereby discouraging other bids .
29063	The fund invests mainly in gold and silver bullion .
29070	Comair said it paid cash but declined to disclose the price .
29073	The unit will be renamed Comair Aviation Academy and will continue to be headed by Scott Williams , a son of its founder , Comair said .
29079	The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share .
29084	So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event .
29085	One analyst , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid `` in the $ 225 area , '' but that it could take three to four months to close .
29086	At that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes UAL stock should trade closer to
29087	Other observers note that UAL 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal .
29089	Investment bankers following UAL agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success .
29090	The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds .
29096	That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ 1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone .
29100	The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking .
29103	In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions .
29104	Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 .
29106	Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike .
29109	American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results .
29113	In addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in Washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt .
29115	Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding .
29122	Net income \* : $ 599.9 million ; or $ 20.20 a share
29126	Eastern Enterprises , bolstered by improved tonnages in its marine-shipping unit , had a narrower third-quarter net loss of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share .
29127	Last year , Eastern had a quarter loss of $ 1.7 million , or eight cents a share .
29129	The Weston , Mass. , utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter , usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business , were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company .
29130	For the nine months , Eastern had net income of $ 41.8 million , or $ 1.80 a share , up 23 % from $ 33.9 million or $ 1.46 a share a year ago .
29132	Convex Computer Corp. , continuing its rapid growth while other computer companies falter , reported an 87 % increase in third-quarter net income from a year earlier and a 50 % increase in revenue .
29133	Net was $ 3.1 million , or 16 cents a share , up from $ 1.6 million , or nine cents a share .
29135	For the nine months , net was $ 7.7 million , or 41 cents a share , up 97 % from $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , a year earlier .
29137	Convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $ 2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide .
29139	Earlier this month , Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems .
29140	The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers , which `` opens up a phenomenal market for us , '' said Robert J. Paluck , Convex 's chairman , president and chief executive .

29149	More recently , Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said .
29150	Interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , Philip Geier Jr. , made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London , the executives said .
29152	But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units .
29156	Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring .
29157	Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak .
29160	It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi .
29161	And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged .
29163	While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
29164	Campbell-Mithun-Esty , for example , has had big problems at its New York office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including Minneapolis and Chicago .
29167	Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , Jeep\/Eagle and Dow Brands .
29168	Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms .
29170	Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm .
29172	Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
29176	In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates , a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk , a unit of the Lowe Group ; Grey Advertising ; and WPP Group 's Scali , McCabe , Sloves agency .
29178	A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in Newark , N.J. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months .
29182	Among other things , the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would `` embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board . ''
29186	The agency declined comment , but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen .
29193	N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J. Siano , said the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk , a midsized Chicago agency , but a deal is n't yet close to being completed .
29195	John Wells , 47 , former president and chief executive of N W Ayer 's Chicago office , was named management director and director of account services at WPP Group 's J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago ... .
29196	Shelly Lazarus , 42 , was named president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct , the direct mail division of WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency .
29197	Grand Metropolitan PLC , the United Kingdom food and beverage group that owns Pillsbury Inc. of the U.S. , announced a reshuffling of board-level executive duties intended to fit the company 's recent expansion .
29199	In a statement , Grand Met said its recent `` growth and wider geographic spread '' made it necessary to create the new position .
29201	David Tagg , formerly in charge of gambling operations , was appointed chief executive for retailing and property .
29202	Peter Cawdron , group strategy development director , and Bill Shardlow , group personnel director , will become part of the board 's management committee .
29207	It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore 's impending appointment .
29209	Readers of these columns -LRB- `` The Science Police , '' May 15 -RRB- will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere .
29211	Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era .
29213	John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .
29214	Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell .
29219	NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch .
29220	Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power .
29221	In a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work .
29222	When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .
29226	A company official said Arthur Borie , until January chief operating officer of Pic 'N Save Inc. , will buy a 20 % stake in the new Wisconsin Toy subsidiary , and will act as head of Everything 's a Dollar .
29238	Ducks are this season 's word for new taxes , under OMB Director Richard Darman 's formulation that `` if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's a duck . ''
29241	We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities .
29247	The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from .
29249	The President came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill .
29250	It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services .
29251	They 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities .
29252	The initial costs are said to be in the $ 2 billion a year range , but that 's only the beginning .
29255	The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range .
29268	Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill .
29269	The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions .
29270	All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments .
29271	Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s .
29273	`` Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business , '' the vice president declared when he was head of the task force .
29276	Then it turned up , and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year .
29283	Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September , due for release tomorrow , fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits .
29286	This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound , economists and foreign exchange market analysts say .
29289	Forecasts for the trade figures range widely , but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # 2 billion -LRB- $ 3.2 billion -RRB- deficit in the current account reported for August .
29290	The August deficit and the # 2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the # 2.3 billion deficit of October 1988 .
29292	At the same time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows .
29302	The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago .
29303	This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 .
29304	Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises .
29305	Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further .
29310	In European trading it declined to $ 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $ 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday .
29311	Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged .
29324	The letter , attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said the approval is also contingent upon obtaining satisfactory financing .

29335	Freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation .
29336	Trucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport .
29337	Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years .
29338	That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad .
29339	`` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co .
29340	Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year .
29342	`` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus .
29343	The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation .
29345	Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 .
29348	`` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
29351	Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
29354	`` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
29357	Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks .
29359	Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases .
29360	Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros .
29364	Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan .
29365	Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years .
29368	Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels .
29370	MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares .

29373	Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\/casino and theme park .
29378	After the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` Go ahead and tell us what happened .
29379	We may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . ''
29380	No lawyers or tape recorders were present .
29381	The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists , one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture .
29384	When he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses .
29386	Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
29388	The court is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year .
29389	Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis , the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis , a General Electric plant in Columbia , Md. , or a number of other companies .
29394	It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations .
29396	It increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control .
29400	It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases .
29406	2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach .
29407	See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators .
29409	In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen .
29411	3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator .
29412	A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support .
29413	An adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy .
29414	International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach .
29417	Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints .
29418	On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists .
29419	Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs .

29434	The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 .
29435	The Second Section index , which rose 15.72 points Thursday , was up 11.88 points , or 0.32 % , to close at 3717.46 .
29439	The Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo .
29442	Investors are still waiting to see how the U.S. government will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be stabilized .
29447	Breweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans , traders said .
29448	Sapporo gained 80 to 1,920 and Kirin added 60 to 2,070 .
29449	Housings , constructions and pharmaceuticals continued to be bought following Thursday 's gains because of strong earnings outlooks .
29452	Kajima advanced 40 to 2,120 and Ohbayashi added 50 to 1,730 .
29453	Fujisawa added 80 to 2,010 and Mochida advanced 230 to 4,400 .
29454	London share prices were influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British pound .
29455	The key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 , above its intraday low of 2176.9 , but off the day 's high of 2189 .
29457	London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September .
29460	Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares .
29461	Dealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday .
29475	Elsewhere in Europe , share prices closed higher in Stockholm , Brussels and Milan .
29476	Prices were lower in Frankfurt , Zurich , Paris and Amsterdam .
29478	Share prices closed higher in Sydney , Taipei , Wellington , Manila , Hong Kong and Singapore and were lower in Seoul .
29483	The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee .
29488	No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him .
29489	What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .
29490	The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules .
29492	It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
29496	Sen. Boren said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future .
29498	Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . ''
29500	But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress .
29501	Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October .
29502	The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations .
29503	In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to .
29506	Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama .
29507	One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .
29509	In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign .
29514	Nevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president .
29519	MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties -LRB- they had been in Britain for a century -RRB- , but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s .
29523	This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place .
29525	An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed $ 1 price .
29531	Actually , the funds do fluctuate , but beyond the third decimal place .
29538	Procter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. said they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $ 1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G .
29540	P&G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&G shares .
29542	The company already markets a wide range of detergents , food , household and health-care products .
29544	The owners of the defense and aerospace concern , which include three regional states , several industrial companies and banks , met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction , in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01 % of
29545	But agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen , which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region .
29546	The two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern .
29547	Jeffrey E. Levin was named vice president and chief economist of this commodity futures and options exchange .

29553	The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York .
29557	The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate .
29560	In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter .
29564	On the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . ''
29567	By and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions .
29568	Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas .
29570	He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures .
29571	Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports .
29572	The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption .
29573	In August , personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % .
29577	HASTINGS MANUFACTURING Co. declared a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share and an extra dividend of five cents a share on its common stock , payable Dec. 15 to shares of record Nov. 17 .

29580	Vickers PLC , a United Kingdom defense and engineering company , said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 % the previous week .
29583	In May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year .
29586	Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses .
29588	`` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls .
29589	Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
29596	On Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange .
29608	That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years .
29610	Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux , Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results .
29611	The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns .
29612	Between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
29615	Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd .
29617	`` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London .
29625	Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid .
29626	Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf .
29627	Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .
29630	But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president says .
29633	`` The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says .
29635	And investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses Trelleborg is in .
29637	Excluding the gain , the company registered a modest 4.6 % increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to $ 113 million , or 87 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 107.9 million , or 84 cents a share .
29638	Proceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share .
29641	Without the Adobe gain , Apple 's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5 % to $ 406 million , or $ 3.16 a share , from $ 400.3 million , or $ 3.08 a share .
29642	Including the Adobe gain , full-year net was $ 454 million , or $ 3.53 a share .
29644	John Sculley , chairman and chief executive officer , credited the Macintosh SE\/30 and IIcx computers , introduced in the winter , for the brightened sales performance .
29649	Lower component costs -- especially for DRAMs , or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company , a spokeswoman said .
29651	Gary J. Schantz , 44 years old , was named president and chief operating officer .
29656	Mr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp .
29658	The company also said it privately placed stock and warrants in exchange for $ 750,000 .
29661	He remains an executive vice president , the company said , and his new position reflects `` the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman 's high performance plastic materials . ''
29662	Gordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations , and Mr. Kushkin 's former position is n't being filled at this time , the company said .
29666	GE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion .
29668	Of the $ 4.4 billion spent so far on the program , 60 % is going for administrative costs , management and research , the Office of Technology Assessment just reported .
29672	It may not be toxic , but we know where one waste dump is .
29674	Purchase of the businesses serving Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach , Fla. , is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry .
29676	Basf AG said it moved its headquarters for Latin America to Mexico and the headquarters for the Asia\/Australia regional division to Singapore , effective Oct .
29680	David H. Eisenberg , 53 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Imasco 's 500-store Peoples Drug Stores Inc. unit , based in Alexandria , Va .
29681	Mr. Eisenberg was senior executive vice president and chief operating officer .
29682	Imasco is a tobacco , retailing , restaurant and financial services concern .
29685	Signal , which has an estimated 10,000 subscribers and is profitable , provides stock quotes over an FM radio band that can be received by specially equipped personal computers .
29688	The business is n't related to Lotus 's main businesses of making computer software and publishing information on compact disks .
29695	Indeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant .
29696	Of the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece .
29697	In October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos .
29700	Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .
29701	In addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization . ''
29703	The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds .
29705	But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments .
29725	Separately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines , or Picop , as the paper mill is known .
29727	But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n't the only consideration .
29729	-LRB- About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . -RRB-
29731	The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say .
29732	Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
29736	Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency .
29738	The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
29740	The new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger , president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. , and Peter S. Willmott , chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc .
29741	Gerard E. Wood , 51 years old , was elected president , chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company .
29742	He succeeds Harry A. Durney , 65 , who is retiring from active duty but remains a director and consultant .
29743	Mr. Wood has been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc .
29744	Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. , two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction .
29745	The new holding company , Webster\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. , will have about $ 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut .
29747	The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement .
29752	Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million .
29753	Their indicated market values thus are about $ 43.3 million and $ 28.6 million , respectively .
29754	Frank J. Pascale , chairman of Eagle , will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith , president and chief executive officer of Webster , will take those posts at Webster\/Eagle .
29755	Harold W. Smith Sr. , chairman of Webster , will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company .
29758	In an interview , James Smith said the banks ' `` markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative . ''
29761	Eagle , which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington , had assets of $ 469.6 million on that date .
29762	Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well .
29768	-LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB-
29770	'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .
29771	I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint .
29773	They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution .
29774	In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . ''
29776	The bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform .
29778	To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability .
29782	Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
29784	The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion .
29787	People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out .
29790	Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained .
29797	The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control .
29798	The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % .
29799	It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % .
29800	Management 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air .
29802	Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time .
29810	However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
29816	Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
29818	`` La Familia de Hoy , '' or `` Today 's Family , '' will debut this spring and will combine a national bimonthly magazine and TV programming .
29820	The features will focus on `` parenting , family health and nutrition , and financial management , '' and will carry 30 seconds of advertising .
29821	The magazines , also ad-supported , will be distributed in more than 10,000 doctors ' offices , clinics , and health centers in Hispanic and largely Hispanic communities .
29823	The 10 7\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said .
29825	Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's capital spending program .
29827	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own .
29829	Lep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said .
29833	U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies , gold , special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF .
29835	U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $ 247 million , to $ 9.49 billion , and its reserve position at the IMF increased $ 142 million , to $ 8.79 billion .

29840	Manhattan National Corp. said Michael A. Conway , president and chief executive officer , was elected chief executive of the holding company 's two principal insurance subsidiaries .
29842	Mr. Conway , 42 years old , was elected chairman , president and chief executive of Manhattan Life Insurance Co. and president and chief executive of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co .
29844	Mr. Conway was executive vice president and chief investment officer of Union Central Life Insurance Co. , of Cincinnati , in 1987 , when Union Central bought a 54 % interest in Manhattan National Corp .
29847	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Terra said he sold 263,684 First Illinois common shares from Aug. 9 to Aug. 28 for $ 9.9375 to $ 10.5625 a share .
29850	He may sell more shares in the open market or in private transactions , but would n't rule out changing his intentions and buying shares , the filing said .
29855	SciMed said it `` remains committed '' both to the `` vigorous defense '' of its position that the catheter does n't infringe the Lilly unit 's patent , and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims , which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts .
29857	The new proposal , which would transfer majority ownership of United Air 's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands , would be valued at $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or as much as $ 5.42 billion .
29860	Ford and Saab ended talks about a possible alliance after Ford concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return .

29877	Trucking , shipping and air-freight firms are all planning rate increases , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand .
29880	Winnebago posted a widened quarterly loss and slashed its dividend in half , reflecting the deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle sales .
29891	Inmac Corp. , a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories , said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds .
29893	The directors ' action , taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday , had little or no effect on the company 's stock , which stagnated at $ 4.75 in light over-the-counter trading .
29894	Inmac recently disclosed a $ 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a $ 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.02 a share .
29896	`` The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results , '' said Kenneth A. Eldred , president and chief executive officer .
29897	`` All our efforts are now focused on improving earnings to the point where we can fund additional new-country development , continue to invest in the business and reinstate the dividend , '' he added .
29898	The company offers more than 3,500 parts and supplies directly to microcomputer and minicomputer users through catalog sales .
29899	The Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville , N.Y .
29901	The FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets , chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because , it said , the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was .
29902	American Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA .
29905	Last month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit .
29908	Lyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % , to $ 73 million , or 91 cents a share , from $ 160 million a year earlier .
29911	The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant .
29912	Like other refiners , Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower .
29913	While the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter , costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete .
29916	Jurors in U.S. District Court in Miami cleared Harold Hershhenson , a former executive vice president ; John Pagones , a former vice president ; and Stephen Vadas and Dean Ciporkin , who had been engineers with Cordis .

29923	The pact proposes a 2 1\/2-year contract with a raise of 8 % in the first year , 7 % in the second and 4 % for the final six months .
29924	Amgen Inc. said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , due to increased sales of the company 's new antianemia drug for kidney patients .
29926	In the year-ago period , Amgen reported net income of $ 320,000 , or two cents a share , on revenue of $ 21.5 million .
29927	For the six months , the company reported a more than sixfold increase in earnings to $ 4.7 million , or 26 cents a share , from $ 625,000 , or four cents a share a year ago .
29929	LEBANESE LAWMAKERS APPROVED a peace plan but Aoun rejected it .
29930	Lebanon 's Parliament passed the power-sharing accord to end the country 's 14-year-old conflict , but the Christian military leader wad the plan was `` full of ambiguities . ''
29931	The Arab League-sponsored pact , drafted during three weeks of talks at the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif , includes Syrian proposals for at least a partial troop pullout from Lebanon , and guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians in the Parliament .
29932	The rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt .
29937	The baseball commissioner announced that the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics would n't resume until Friday .

29962	Scientists have isolated a molecule that may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma , Immunex Corp. said .
29963	The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor , which directs the growth and function of white blood cells .
29965	Contel Corp. said third-quarter net income increased 16 % to $ 72 million , or 45 cents a share , from $ 62 million , or 39 cents a share , as a result of strong growth in telephone-access lines and long-distance minutes of use .
29966	The telecommunications company 's results included a one-time gain of $ 4 million , or two cents a share , from the sale of Contel Credit , a leasing and financial-services subsidiary .
29970	Customer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4 % and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12 % .
29971	A 10 % gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21 % boost in interest expense , reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest rates .
29979	According to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies .
29980	Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
29982	The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost .
29984	`` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . ''
29988	Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
29993	Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev .
30002	`` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
30005	He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. Honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent .
30006	Barbara Donovan , an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich , says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer .
30009	The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 .
30011	`` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . ''
30016	`` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a 30-year-old East German doctor .
30019	The walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition .
30022	Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production .
30025	`` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the East Berlin shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it .
30031	Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end .
30032	This was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May , at the height of the controversy , when more than 1,500 scientists , along with scores of reporters and TV crews , crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject .
30033	Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons , were at the meeting .
30036	Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons .
30037	The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium .
30038	When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate .
30039	Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
30040	But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
30042	Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .
30050	When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said .
30052	It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down .
30054	Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
30057	The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on .
30060	Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt .
30064	Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water .
30065	He said that within the past few days , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium .
30066	There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
30068	Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
30069	Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
30070	A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event .
30071	Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
30072	In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
30074	At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
30077	The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts .
30078	The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 .
30079	`` Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up , '' said Peter R. Kann , president of Dow Jones .
30080	`` We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs .
30081	Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers . ''
30082	Advertising rates for the Eastern , Midwest , Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5 % , and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5 % .
30085	Advertising rates for The Wall Street Journal\/Europe , published in Brussels and printed in the Netherlands and Switzerland , will increase 9 % .
30086	Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal , published and printed in Hong Kong and also printed in Singapore and Tokyo , will rise 8 % .
30088	Dow Jones also publishes Barron 's magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .
30090	Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending , Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier .
30091	Net fell to $ 65 million , or 67 cents a common share , from $ 93.7 million or $ 1.03 a share , a year ago .
30093	For the nine months , the electronics and defense concern had net of $ 255.8 million , or $ 2.70 a share , down 5.6 % from $ 271 million , or $ 3.01 a share , in the year-ago period .
30095	Jerry Junkins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
30096	That , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
30097	In addition , cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net .
30101	`` We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market , '' he said , `` and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand . ''
30108	The company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass-making and food-processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .
30112	While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says .
30113	Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions .
30115	Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say .
30117	Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say .
30118	Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say .
30119	Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
30123	Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union .
30124	Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says .
30126	Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .
30127	Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says .
30130	A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report .
30131	This year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says Rhona O'Connell , London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
30133	Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say .
30138	Livestock and Meats
30151	Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
30152	Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
30153	Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm .
30166	`` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
30175	It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
30176	Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
30182	The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn .
30183	Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
30185	A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
30187	Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
30190	`` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains .
30191	As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
30192	The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
30193	The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .
30194	Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower .
30197	But early this year , PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says John Rohs , an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co .
30202	The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
30203	The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
30206	Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . ''
30208	If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
30211	The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available .
30216	Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations .
30217	Jack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales .
30222	Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict .
30224	The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
30225	Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers .
30232	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .

30242	CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand .
30247	`` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says Jack Smalling , a dealer in Ames , Iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .
30250	`` For someone who has everything else -- Reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says William Vizas , owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver , who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show .
30251	For years , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold .
30253	`` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks , '' says Mr. Smalling .
30255	`` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif .
30267	USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market .
30270	Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel .
30277	The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees .
30280	USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 .
30281	USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production .
30287	You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . ''
30289	There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
30290	So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
30293	Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions .
30294	With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . ''
30295	It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . ''
30296	For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .
30299	Limit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
30300	Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
30303	One risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .
30305	Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
30306	Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
30307	Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
30308	While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
30309	In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
30310	The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
30321	It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
30322	But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled .
30325	`` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . ''
30327	It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
30329	One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .
30331	Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
30337	On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .
30338	They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
30340	Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences .
30341	Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal .
30344	Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
30345	For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
30346	Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
30348	So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on .
30353	`` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . ''
30354	In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .
30355	That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .
30357	In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .
30359	`` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago-based group .
30360	`` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .
30363	When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ?
30365	If you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
30367	But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
30369	Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds .
30375	That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time .
30376	But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
30385	The portfolios of two hypothetical families , one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 , illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider .
30387	But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
30392	-LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
30393	Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation .
30395	Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range .
30400	`` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . ''
30402	When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way .
30404	Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills .
30406	For instance , some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market .
30413	It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners .
30415	In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition , Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap .
30418	Capital has been democratized , and people want in .
30420	Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit !
30421	This is particularly good news for those who hate risk , who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way .
30425	So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market .
30431	Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health .
30433	Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already !
30440	Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all .
30441	All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential .
30443	Personal space -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade , a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles , which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day .
30447	Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .
30448	I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers .
30451	Over the course of the decade , for instance , my return on investment in the area of poker alone -LRB- Figures 7A and 7B -RRB- has been most impressive , showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way my associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond .
30452	With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage .
30456	So go out there and eat that debt .
30459	Mr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York .
30462	He tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers .
30466	Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` anybody who can fog a mirror '' can call himself a financial planner .
30467	Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars , but in effect they operate in the dark .
30469	All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning .
30470	So it should come as no shock that the profession , if that 's what it is , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money .
30471	Alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners .
30472	Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards , too ; they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
30475	An admittedly limited survey by NASAA , whose members are state securities-law regulators , found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million .
30476	The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
30477	What 's more , the losses they and the others caused `` are just what we are stumbling over , '' says Mr. Stapf , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected .
30479	Nobody can estimate the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery .
30483	She concedes that such a position is `` unfair '' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade , but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it .
30484	She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps `` were still getting ripped off . ''
30486	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
30487	But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners -LRB- IAFP -RRB- , the industry 's biggest trade group , is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 , and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
30488	An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
30489	A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
30491	Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
30497	Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
30500	Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
30505	The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification .
30507	It requires financial planners to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
30509	NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend .
30510	The issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ?
30512	In its notice of action , the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the attorney general alleged , the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos .
30516	And , the attorney general added , First Meridian 's president , Roger V. Sala , portrayed himself as a `` financial expert '' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth .
30517	First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
30518	Harry Manion , Mr. Sala 's attorney , says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect .
30521	Two such actions , both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta , could be particularly embarrassing to the industry : both name J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP , as defendant .
30522	One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest .
30523	Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges .
30526	In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
30527	Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors .
30528	Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots , he opened up his briefcase and dumped $ 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors , says Myron Diebel , the bank 's president .
30530	Bank officials , however , showed him the door , and the sale never came off .
30537	Rearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths . ''
30543	In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way .
30546	Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner .
30547	Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County .
30548	CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing `` bank '' in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too .
30553	At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center , the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards .
30554	They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire .
30556	They graze at the Farmers Market , a combination gourmet food court and grocery store , while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies .
30563	This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents .
30564	It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' .
30567	The places renowned for breeding bunco , like the Miami neighborhood known as the `` Maggot Mile '' and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast cars , high rollers , glamorous women and lots of sunshine .
30568	You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo .
30573	The breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily .
30577	`` Blondes , cocaine and Corvettes , '' mutters Mr. McClelland .
30583	But above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
30587	And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles .
30589	That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as `` Hollywood '' scams .
30590	Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .
30592	In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month .
30594	Douglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors .
30595	`` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. Jones says , `` but no intent to defraud . ''
30600	When we go there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . ''
30603	Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators .
30604	With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .
30605	`` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says .
30606	All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
30607	Vincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project .
30608	Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable .
30613	YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education .
30616	Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow .
30618	In short , throw away the passbook and go for the glory .
30623	By 2007 , when this year 's newborns hit campus , a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost $ 300,000 , give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time .
30624	Stanford , MIT and other utmosts will cost no less .
30637	The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools .
30640	But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine .
30641	Belatedly aware of public concern , lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes .
30642	Their message , explicit or implicit , is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore .
30643	Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund .
30645	Several outfits -- including the Financial Programs , Franklin , and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house -- are advertising `` college planner '' tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
30647	Most of the mailers are free , but Denver-based Financial Programs sells , for $ 15 , a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice .
30651	And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier -- when mother and child come home from the hospital .
30659	`` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says .
30664	That way , parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition .
30665	Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages .
30666	He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
30667	In their anxiety , however , parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes .
30668	They have laid out about $ 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by Connecticut , Illinois , Virginia and eight other states .
30669	And they have bought about $ 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans , offered in Michigan , Florida and Wyoming .
30670	The prepaid plans take payment today -- usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount -- for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow .
30671	The baccalaureate bonds -- tax-free , offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity -- seem to be tailor-made for college savers .
30676	Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up .
30677	That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal .
30678	Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures .
30681	Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions , however , and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools .
30682	Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable .
30687	But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so .
30688	One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable .
30690	Based on historical rates of return , Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio , indexed to the market , would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century .
30695	Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
30698	The state says there 's no worry -- investment returns , combined with fees and the gains from unused plans , will provide all the cash it needs .
30700	If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 , 1990 , here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale , Notre Dame and University of Minnesota .
30701	Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition , fees , room and board and an 8 % annual investment return .
30702	Note : These figures are only for mandatory charges and do n't include books , transportation etc .
30705	AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising .
30706	He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds , and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he `` live-hauled '' to market along with his own whiskery crop .
30707	And he nearly always bought and sold for cash .
30710	Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers , live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by Mr. Tharp and others .
30711	Unknown to Mr. Tharp , he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes .
30712	Confronted with the evidence , Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
30713	He also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties .
30715	Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions .
30716	Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off .
30718	Now , television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
30720	IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners .
30722	Once such abuses become so pervasive , the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
30724	Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
30726	And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .
30730	In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
30732	Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like .
30733	The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
30734	Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax .
30735	And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased .
30737	It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says .
30738	The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
30739	The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .
30740	For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 .
30741	The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it .
30742	The Direct Selling Association , a trade group , points out that its members , which include Amway Corp. , cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
30744	In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports Raymond P. Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .
30746	Many workers , especially professionals , want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't .
30747	But many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for the IRS , says Jerry Lackey , who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando .
30749	In his area , Mr. Lackey continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work .
30750	But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors .
30752	It assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents .
30753	Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 .
30754	The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
30756	The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax .
30757	Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .
30758	The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .
30762	In finding `` good news '' in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan -LRB- `` The Privileged Class , '' editorial , Sept. 20 -RRB- , you 're reading the headline but not the story .
30768	But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , English-language proficiency and an essay .
30769	This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
30772	The plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them about 10 % of the class .
30775	But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
30786	Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner ?
30790	There are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them .
30793	John Blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know .
30794	He used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins .
30795	`` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he says .
30798	Everyone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami .
30801	`` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville .
30802	`` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . ''
30808	Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors .
30809	The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office .
30810	Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .
30811	Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . ''
30813	In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
30819	-LRB- Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation .
30820	He says he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . -RRB-
30826	But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy .
30828	Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division .
30830	But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
30832	Scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves .
30836	William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed .
30841	-LRB- Donald Trinen , an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm , denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment . -RRB-
30842	`` It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients , '' says Terree Bowers , chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles .
30847	`` Sometimes when people are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm .
30848	`` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . ''
30849	They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money - retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses .
30850	`` These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
30854	`` We were saving up to buy a house , and my wife was pregnant , '' says Mr. Cortese .
30855	`` It was just before the Christmas holidays , and I figured we could use some extra cash . ''
30858	`` Maybe the next day or even an hour later , I would n't have done it . ''
30861	Two seats on the Big Board were sold yesterday for $ 455,000 , and then $ 500,000 .
30864	Seats are currently quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked .
30865	FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at least it 's exercise .
30870	But sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work .
30872	I 'm 33 , married , no children , and employed in writing stories like this one .
30873	In times past , life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it .
30874	So if anything happened to me , I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts -LRB- though not , I admit , enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury -RRB- .
30875	Figuring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
30876	Over the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations .
30877	Besides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .
30880	Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
30883	But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .
30885	Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
30887	There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .
30890	Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .
30891	Sounds great -- or does it ?
30893	Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .
30894	Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .
30895	That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me .
30898	If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins .
30900	This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value .
30901	The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .
30902	The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
30904	The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
30905	That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
30909	So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
30911	You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
30912	One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
30913	Congress closed this loophole last year , or thought it did .
30914	However , Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .
30918	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
30919	In looking at these and other policies , I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years .
30920	They commonly give two scenarios : One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees -LRB- usually 4 % to 4.5 % -RRB- and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5 % or more .
30921	Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?
30923	Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year .
30925	Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
30926	Another factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .
30927	There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
30928	At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . ''
30933	Some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is maintained for 10 years .
30937	Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .
30938	Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants .
30939	But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
30943	Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
30945	After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable .
30951	A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
30952	Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset sales , Robert Cawthorn , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said .
30953	His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents a share , compared with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents a share , a year ago .
30960	He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million .
30962	Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 .
30963	He said the company is still looking for `` a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . ''
30964	Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 .
30965	He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 .
30966	`` We had underfunded Maalox for a year , '' he said , because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs .
30967	He said Rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period .
30969	Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook .
30971	Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe , rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas , and declining demand .
30972	HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary , Home Federal Savings & Loan , converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank .
30974	The change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits , federal regulatory powers or company operations , a spokesman said .
30975	It was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash , but this time it was different .

30993	Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so : Holiday Corp. gained 1 7\/8 to 73 and Honeywell rose 2 7\/8 to 81 1\/2 .
31002	Indeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices .

31012	Chemical and six other banks , along with First Boston , are providing the rest of the $ 1.6 billion .
31013	Elsewhere on the takeover front , Time Warner advanced 2 5\/8 to 136 5\/8 and Warner Communications tacked on 7\/8 to 63 7\/8 .

31053	In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley -LRB- D. , Wash . -RRB- had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
31056	If you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news .
31057	You 're probably right , and you are n't alone .
31058	A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression .
31059	The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies .
31063	Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
31064	In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression .
31068	Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance .
31070	The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .
31071	The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing .
31074	Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings .
31075	The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production .
31076	Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled .
31077	Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . ''
31079	`` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm .
31087	This week , many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year , including Christmas .
31091	They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 and 31 , and Jan. 4 , 5 and 6 .
31092	The promotions -- dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares -- put round-trip fares at $ 98 , $ 148 and $ 198 .
31096	IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way , couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts .
31097	Continental , a Texas Air Corp. unit , recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights .
31098	The Continental catch : Only immediate family members are allowed , and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related .
31105	The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family .
31108	WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states , it downed electric and telephone lines , shot coconuts through cottage rooftops , shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives .
31110	Since the hurricane , Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines , a unit of AMR Corp. , trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to $ 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm .
31111	The fares are code-named Hugo , Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid .
31112	-LRB- Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake , but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips . -RRB-
31114	In Myrtle Beach , S.C. , the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as $ 35 , or as much as 22 % below regular prices .
31115	Says Michele Hoffman , a clerk in the resort 's front office : `` We do n't have the outdoor pool , the pool table , ping pong table , snack bar or VCR , but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi . ''
31119	A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare .
31125	THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers , retired military personnel and medical students .
31129	In an official release , BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 .
31130	As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil .
31135	Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .
31141	When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago , Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory .
31145	But just down Seventh Avenue , where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made , Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather .
31147	The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years .
31150	`` We make the finest product in the world , and the Americans are being kicked around . ''
31153	Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years .
31156	It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other countries .
31157	Jindo Furs , a large South Korean maker , says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year .
31158	Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made .
31160	But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick , who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district , say imports have cut their sales .
31161	A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 .
31163	Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation .
31166	He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit .
31167	By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost .
31168	To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S. .
31170	Inspired by imports , Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs , hats and flings .
31171	This year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green .
31172	He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars .
31175	He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets .
31181	This year he bought two stores , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
31183	Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago , and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income .
31185	Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest .
31188	The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 sales have languished at their $ 1.8 billion peak .
31189	Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. , Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years .
31191	In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down .
31196	But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
31197	`` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
31202	Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said .
31203	The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
31208	The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said .
31209	Hepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said .
31214	`` We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot , '' Mr. Mattausch added , `` and that means virtually everyone who works here .
31221	Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories .
31225	Anton Amon and George Gourlay were elected vice presidents of this soft-drink company .
31228	In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy .
31232	A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued .
31234	In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
31235	He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
31238	Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % .
31247	He added that `` there 's no quick-fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said `` tight monetary policy is the right approach . ''
31251	Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .
31255	Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
31256	An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December .
31258	The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
31260	Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors .
31261	Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
31263	Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals -LRB- a role usually filled by a minicomputer -RRB- , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
31264	`` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman said .
31267	The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second , or MIPS , while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS .
31268	Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC\/Bunker Ramo unit , which specializes in automating bank-branch networks .
31272	Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility .
31273	Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery , and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries .
31274	Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation , boosting the average monthly benefit to $ 566 from $ 541 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced .
31278	As mandated by law , the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future .
31279	This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise $ 250.80 next year to $ 3,855.60 .
31282	The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year .
31285	To offset sluggish sales growth , companies have been cutting staff , mostly through attrition , and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
31290	The Franklin Lakes , N.J. , company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % , but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % , says Jerry E. Fuller , an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc .
31291	Among the first of the group to post results , Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to $ 196 million , or 88 cents a share , from $ 172 million , or 76 cents a share , a year earlier .
31293	Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to $ 102 million , or 34 cents a share , from $ 85 million , or 28 cents a share , a year earlier .
31296	C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to $ 9.9 million , or 18 cents a share , from $ 20 million , or 35 cents a share , a year earlier .
31300	The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design .
31305	Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals , National Medical Enterprises Inc. , Los Angeles , reported net income of $ 50 million , or 65 cents a share , for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 41 million , or 56 cents a share , a year earlier .
31306	Humana Inc. , Louisville , Ky. , also reported favorable results , with net income of $ 66.7 million , or 66 cents , in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 58.2 million , or 59 cents , a year earlier .
31309	Moreover , companies have sold off many of their smaller , less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
31313	The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % .
31314	Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier .
31316	A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
31319	Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter , analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders .
31320	The Maynard , Mass. , company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .
31321	Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 150.8 million , or $ 1.20 a share , from $ 223 million , or $ 1.71 a share , a year ago .
31323	Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins .
31328	`` Until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said Mark Steinkrauss , Digital 's director of investor relations .
31332	Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
31334	`` Margins will remain under pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
31340	`` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe , Mr. Stevens said .
31342	Although overall revenues were stronger , Mr. Schulman said , DEC `` drew down its European backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall .
31348	Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
31349	Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ 76.7 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales that increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion .
31350	In the year-earlier period , Colgate posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share .
31351	Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ 13.1 million , or 19 cents a share .
31352	Reuben Mark , chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America , the Far East and Europe .
31354	Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses , which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent , jumped more than 40 % , the company said .
31355	Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
31356	`` We 've done a lot to improve -LRB- U.S. . -RRB- results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said .
31362	For the nine months , net increased 14 % to $ 217.5 million , or $ 3.09 a share .
31364	The company earned $ 191.1 million , or $ 2.79 a share , in the year-earlier period .
31365	Colgate 's 1988 net income included $ 40.1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations .
31366	Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
31367	Separately , Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica , Mass. , to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
31368	The products -- sealants and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain fluoride that is released over time .
31372	USACafes , which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
31376	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year .
31381	Net income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million , or 55 cents a share .
31383	The latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
31386	But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
31387	Under the amended pension program , AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
31388	Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier .
31391	`` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
31393	`` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
31398	For the nine months , AT&T said net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85 a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56 a share .
31401	When it comes to buying and selling shares , Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
31402	Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates .
31403	That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
31407	Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance .
31408	Institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
31409	These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it .
31411	That 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
31414	`` Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there , '' says Seth M. Lynn , president of Axe Core Investors Inc. , an indexer based in Tarrytown , N.Y .
31416	Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
31417	They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country .
31418	With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
31419	Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
31421	`` There is n't a boatload -LCB- of big investors -RCB- out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services .
31424	Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that .
31431	The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
31432	Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
31433	And in some months , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
31434	`` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. Carder adds .
31437	J. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
31438	`` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says .
31439	But some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
31452	Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- .
31457	Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
31458	One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
31459	Another approach : An investor with $ 100 million might use $ 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .
31463	Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System , for example , has about $ 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state .
31469	Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
31476	Some analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
31478	Varity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp. , consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp. , for $ 577.3 million of cash and securities .
31487	The company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs .
31493	The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September .
31496	My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
31497	Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling -LRB- and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative -RRB- .
31498	The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .
31499	It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
31500	Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
31501	As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee , the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled . ''
31502	As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .
31505	Throughout 1988 and this year , I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this `` narcokleptocrat '' out of Panama .
31506	Regrettably , two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan , military or economic , for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy .
31509	After years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 , but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action .
31516	Mr. Chan , now 64 years old , invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste .
31519	For his troubles , Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 .
31520	Though his operation was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials .
31522	Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did .
31525	Newspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire king . ''
31526	His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local authorities .
31527	District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home , which he and his large family used as both residence and factory , and demanded proof the house and equipment were his .
31529	`` That was the first time they lost and I won , '' he says .
31530	He was further questioned to determine if he was `` a real working man or an exploiter . ''
31532	But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property .
31534	His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated .
31537	He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights .
31538	He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd jobs .
31539	Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a weekly newspaper .
31543	Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house .
31544	Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms -- the Chans , four of their 10 children with spouses , and eight of 22 grandchildren .
31546	Come daybreak , eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street .
31547	The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard , where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water .
31552	Nor did they return his house and contents , which he values at about $ 44,000 .
31560	Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills .
31561	Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered .
31563	Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers .
31564	The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep , a former history teacher , who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association .
31566	`` Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly '' to the restyled paper , says Lai Nguyen An , a literary critic .
31576	She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country .
31579	A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime , she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war .
31587	She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state-owned .
31589	The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities , such as corn and coffee , from farmers in the south , paying with fertilizer , farm tools and other items .
31591	The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses .
31593	In recent years , Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company , taking a 20 % stake in newly established , partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank , and setting up Saigon Petro , which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery .
31595	She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year .
31600	Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties , and `` there are potential isolated problems , '' said Hyman Grossman , a managing director .
31601	The agency is preparing a report , to be issued today , on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry .
31603	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing , with an eye toward a possible downgrade , the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds , long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company , Bay View Capital Corp .
31604	As for property and casualty insurers , Moody 's said `` preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition , '' but it `` raises concerns about potentially substantial risks '' longer-term .
31612	Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $ 2.7 million , or nine cents a share , for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 , citing factors as varied as hurricane damage , an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar .
31613	In the year-ago period , the company earned $ 12.9 million , or 45 cents a share , on sales of $ 247 million .
31617	In its second quarter last year , Western Digital earned $ 12.7 million , or 44 cents a share , on sales of $ 258.4 million .
31622	Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards .
31625	`` The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good , '' Mr. Johnson said .
31626	He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array , VGA , graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter , EGA , which has a lower resolution standard , technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units .
31627	Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift , he said , `` but we were able to respond much more quickly . ''
31629	He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters , while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales .
31630	As part of its reorganization this week , Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products , including controllers and disk drives ; and microcomputer products , which include graphics , communications and peripheral control chips .
31631	Graphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip .
31632	Storage , which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives , represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business .
31635	As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts .
31636	Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and , a block away , a modern $ 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant .
31638	About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas , and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue .
31641	Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution .
31642	Until now , BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree .
31644	The bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury .
31646	The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled .
31651	Switzerland 's wholesale price index increased 0.3 % in September from August , and was up 3.9 % from a year ago , marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4 % on a year-to-year basis , the government reported .
31653	In August , the index was up 0.2 % from the previous month , and was up 4.5 % on a year-to-year basis .
31656	Aided by a sharp gain in its travel business , American Express said net rose to $ 331.8 million , or 77 cents a share , from $ 273.9 million , or 64 cents a share .
31657	The year-earlier figures included $ 9.9 million , or three cents a share , in income from discontinued operations .
31660	The travel , investment services , insurance and banking concern added $ 110 million to reserves for credit losses at its American Express Bank unit , boosting the reserve to $ 507 million as of Sept. 30 .
31667	At IDS Financial Services , the financial planning and mutual fund unit , net rose 19 % to a record $ 47.6 million on a 33 % revenue gain .
31668	Assets owned or managed rose 20 % to $ 45 billion , and mutual fund sales rose 45 % in the quarter to $ 923 million .
31674	For the nine months , American Express said net rose 11 % to $ 899.8 million , or $ 2.09 a share , from $ 807.5 million , or $ 1.89 a share .
31677	The aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5 % to $ 59.5 million from $ 62.8 million .
31680	The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business , lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets .
31683	For the nine months , Textron reported net of $ 182.1 million , or $ 2.06 a share , on revenue of $ 5.41 billion .
31684	A year ago , net was $ 170.4 million , or $ 1.93 a share , on revenue of $ 5.3 billion .
31685	The nine-month results included a $ 9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales , and $ 29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt .
31686	Textron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC , a British maker of industrial fasteners , but do include interest costs of $ 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel .
31688	For the quarter , Textron said aerospace revenue , including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture , declined 9.8 % to $ 755.9 million from $ 838.3 million , an indication of slowing government defense work .
31690	But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988 .
31694	Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it , although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service , which claims the brothers owe $ 1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases .
31695	The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval .
31696	Under it , the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80 % of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors , including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , which is seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan .
31697	A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings .
31698	In both cases , Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie .
31699	With support from the IRS , Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco 's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS .
31702	Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray , attorney for Manufacturers Hanover , called it `` silly '' and said he would fight it in court .
31706	The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $ 88 million , Banc One said .
31708	Society Corp. already has branches in the area , and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society , according to industry sources .
31710	Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $ 6.07 billion in the latest week , the sharpest increase in almost two years .
31714	Individual investors , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds , said Jacob Dreyer , vice president and chief economist of the Institute .
31722	Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles , the institution 's executive chairman , Mohamed Basir Ismail , said .
31724	He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans .
31725	So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars -LRB- US$ 457 million -RRB- in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank , and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital .
31729	Each time , the bank 's 90 % shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd. , or Petronas , the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution .
31731	Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank .
31733	Once the plan is approved , Tan Sri Basir said , most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$ 160 million and M$ 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 .
31736	But public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$ 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party , the United Malays National Organization , to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur .
31739	As well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital .
31742	White , 24 years old , a singer in her church choir , she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan .
31746	Then a political novice , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers .
31751	Polls bear out this warning , but after a decade of increased Republican influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter .
31755	New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion , but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling , Webster vs. Missouri , has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue .
31758	A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest .
31760	`` We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter ... and no one would have heard us . ''
31765	A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to `` man and woman '' Election Day phones .
31770	Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift , but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate .
31771	By a 2-to-1 ratio , voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue .
31773	The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark `` I'm-coming-down-your-throat '' intensity , but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently , he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward .
31775	`` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? ''
31782	Moreover , by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition , Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment .
31783	He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate ; and by wavering on this issue and abortion , he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides .
31785	Like many of his colleagues , he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors .
31786	Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences , and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor , Thomas Kean , in the 1981 Republican primary here .
31787	The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean .
31788	While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office .
31789	Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter , but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government .
31792	Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head .
31793	He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park .
31797	Asked the same question after his appearance , Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today .
31798	When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden .
31799	Details and Camden are essential Florio .
31802	His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge .
31804	More than ever , his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state .
31807	In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . ''
31808	Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses .
31809	He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase state revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste .
31810	Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s .
31811	Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
31813	The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines , but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption .
31814	His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state , and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment , he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater , Trenton State College .
31816	Pasquale Pignatelli , an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band , speaks sadly of Mr. Florio .
31819	Bill Wames Sr. , 72 , is Catholic too , but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion .
31820	A security guard at a cargo terminal , he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating `` The US 1 Band . ''
31825	Energy costs , which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs .
31834	`` We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months , and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now , '' said Jay Woodworth , chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York .
31840	`` It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued Edward Yardeni , chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York .
31841	In both 1987 and 1988 , consumer prices rose 4.4 % .
31842	A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year , but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 % .
31848	The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day .
31851	Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September .
31852	Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % , and housing costs gained only 0.1 % .
31853	Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % , but that was after three months of declines .
31863	Some have built health spas , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski .
31866	Since the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average , compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s .
31869	Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts .
31871	Skiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport .
31876	`` We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff , '' says Kathe Dillmann , a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association , the trade group sponsoring the campaign .
31881	The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers ; normally , they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities .
31882	But in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the Angel Fire , Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts .
31884	Since 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids .
31885	Vail , Colo. , now has a playland that looks like an old mining town ; kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold .
31886	For $ 15 , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad .
31887	A few years ago , parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children .
31888	`` Most parents who had to go through that never came back , '' says Michael Shannon , president of Vail Associates Inc. , which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts .
31889	To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies .
31890	In one phone call , ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons .
31891	And resorts are adding other amenities , such as pricey restaurants , health spas and vacation packages with a twist .
31893	`` People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says Don Borgeson , executive director of Angel Fire , N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce .
31894	The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions .
31896	For one thing , it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive : a lift ticket can cost up to $ 35 a day and equipment prices are rising .
31899	`` Even if they could bring in that many new skiers , I do n't know if -LCB- the industry -RCB- could handle that kind of an increase , '' says I. William Berry , editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah , N.Y .
31900	`` Most people will come on the weekend , the slopes will be overcrowded and then these -LCB- new skiers -RCB- wo n't come back .
31901	They did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled , and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either .
31904	The theory is that the stadium , damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there .
31908	It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake , but the name of this column is `` On Sports , '' so I feel obliged to do so .
31910	As soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show .
31911	One fan , seated several rows in front of the open , upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed , faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted , `` We arranged that just for you guys ! ''
31912	I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . ''
31914	Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat .
31915	`` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my own reaction .
31919	Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played .
31920	`` I was near the top of the stadium , and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat , but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes , '' confessed a friend .
31921	`` I guess I thought , ` This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out ! ' ''
31923	Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful .
31930	The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend .
31935	The only frenzy I saw was commercial : Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items .
31937	It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away .
31939	At my hotel , the Westin , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else .
31940	With Garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the Amfac , had been hit harder : A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away .
31941	The Westin staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets .
31943	I expected him to say , `` I told you so , '' but he already was snoring .
31945	My response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact .
31948	The quake and baseball were n't related , unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics .
31949	That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it .
31951	This has been widely dubbed the BART Series , after the local subway line , and the Bay Bridge Series .
31952	Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti , the late baseball commissioner , and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins .
31955	It now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without `` off '' days .
31958	But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $ 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp .
31959	For more than a decade , banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds .
31960	Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank loans for the $ 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc .
31962	That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover .
31964	Charles Nathan , co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. , says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs .
31966	David Batchelder , a mergers adviser in La Jolla , Calif. , who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year , says that banks have been `` preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing . ''
31968	Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds , which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans .
31972	Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation , or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers .
31978	James B. Lee , head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. , said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance .
31979	As evidence , he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor .
31981	Arthur Fleischer Jr. , a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds .
31982	One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $ 10.7 billion , or $ 175 a share .
31988	The success of the NWA financing , and the failure of the UAL deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks .
31991	Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new , lower bid .
31992	Takanori Mizuno , chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. , a Tokyo research center on finance and economics , says , `` The junk bond market became very jittery , and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies .
31993	Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here , alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made `` false , deceptive and misleading '' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements .
31994	Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group , led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer , violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made , it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law .
31996	But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures , the Rochester , N.Y. , investor said `` we complied with every law , '' and he denied any wrongdoing .
31997	The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson , or seek representation on the company 's board .
31998	Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party .
31999	Inland Steel Industries Inc. , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings .
32000	The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned $ 18.3 million , or 43 cents a share , compared with $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , a year earlier , when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing .
32002	The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share .
32005	The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector .
32007	Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period , and 17 % from this year 's second quarter .
32008	Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ 26 a ton , from $ 66 a ton a year earlier and $ 57 a ton a quarter earlier .
32010	Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar , hot-rolled and structural steel .
32012	The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs .
32014	Meanwhile , the company 's service center segment , which saw operating profit drop to $ 11.5 million from $ 30.7 million a year ago , experienced much of the same demand and cost problems , as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system .
32015	Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is `` clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets . ''
32016	However , he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels , and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter .
32017	In the first nine months , profit was $ 113 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on sales of $ 3.19 billion , compared with $ 204.5 million , or $ 5.76 a share , on sales of $ 3.03 billion , a year earlier .
32019	When things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
32022	Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
32024	And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
32025	In today 's markets , specialists -LRB- on the New York Stock Exchange -RRB- and `` upstairs '' market makers -LRB- in the over-the-counter market -RRB- are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
32027	And when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -LRB- the way prices are determined -RRB- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
32029	When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
32034	When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at various prices -RRB- be made available to all , not just to market makers .
32035	Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information .
32036	To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -LRB- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -RRB- by investors -- particularly institutional investors .
32037	Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
32044	In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at each price -RRB- entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders .
32046	Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a `` national market system '' -LRB- not yet achieved -RRB- almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
32048	Were we smart or just lucky ?
32054	The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
32057	Some may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession .
32058	Different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher .
32059	For those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will be a recession year , many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio .
32060	In a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries .
32070	That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
32083	`` Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could be a disaster . ''
32084	Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
32088	One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach , director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. , a brokerage house in Houston , who thinks that `` we 're either in a recession or about to go into one . ''
32090	Investors , he advises , `` should be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
32092	Instead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills .
32094	He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad .
32095	`` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says .
32097	A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. Confair adds .
32098	It has to be engineered over and over again , month after month .
32099	He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw . ''
32102	For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
32103	Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % , including both dividends and price appreciation .
32104	That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
32108	Investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says .
32109	Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
32114	According to Ned Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis , Fla. , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % , and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started .
32115	By the time a recession is `` official '' -LRB- two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product -RRB- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done - and , in the typical case , the recession is already half over .
32118	Unfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases .
32122	`` Low P-E '' stocks , he says , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . ''
32123	In good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance .
32132	Food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
32133	Recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick .
32143	And Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night .
32146	Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped .
32151	`` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and -LCB- Chicago & North Western -RCB- is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp .
32152	Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
32156	But several mutual-fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
32158	To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds , portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .
32162	According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group , which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each .
32163	That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
32164	Despite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market .
32165	Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point .
32166	In the Treasury market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
32170	But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys .
32187	Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
32192	Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains .
32193	Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week .
32196	Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
32199	According to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
32204	California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official .
32210	Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher , but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
32211	Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
32215	Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 , up 9\/32 , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 , up 6\/32 .
32222	In Japan , the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in West Germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
32224	It may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $ 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo n't you give him the difference ?
32226	Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address ...
32228	But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you .
32232	In fact , the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth .
32236	It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud .
32237	But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
32238	State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
32239	The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
32243	Without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
32246	Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
32247	The state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs .
32248	The telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located .
32249	Running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
32250	The Arthritis Foundation , the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs , not overhead .
32256	The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
32260	State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
32262	This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
32263	The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
32267	Attorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
32268	According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit , Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an additional $ 1,000 on top of them , if they contributed as little as $ 7 .
32269	But the total value of the prizes was only $ 5,000 and most `` winners '' will receive just 10 cents , according to the attorney general 's office .
32275	The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
32277	`` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ! ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says William Webster , attorney general of Missouri .
32280	`` A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages .
32281	I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says .
32283	Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
32284	The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
32286	Most of them do n't last for long , but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us , '' says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association .
32287	And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it .
32288	A couple in Rockford , Ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , without permission from the group .
32291	The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford , law enforcement officials report .
32298	Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group , which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union , failed to obtain financing for the $ 6.79 billion transaction .
32300	However , company officials said they plan to take `` no initiatives '' to resurrect the transaction , and `` are n't aware '' of any restructured bid in the making .
32302	The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday , with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place .
32304	Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board `` at the earliest time possible . ''
32309	In an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department .
32312	The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . ''
32314	Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management .
32315	British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier .
32329	The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul , Weiss , Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
32333	The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the lead banks in the transaction , failed to obtain $ 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan .
32337	For the first six months , wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before , reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales .
32338	Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier .
32342	The plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday .
32343	But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday .
32345	Afterward , leaders of the dissident Democrats relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned .
32350	He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect .
32355	That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators .
32357	Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation .
32358	To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .
32359	The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it .
32368	The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
32369	Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty .
32370	Westmoreland Coal Co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results .
32371	The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million .
32372	For the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents a share .
32373	In the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8.5 million , or $ 1.03 a share .
32376	In an interview , Pemberton Hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest .
32380	Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region .
32381	The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News , Va .
32384	Marginal operations and assets have been sold .
32386	About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
32389	`` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program .
32391	But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
32392	One difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season .
32396	Nevertheless , Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same . ''
32398	An accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents a share .
32409	Of that amount , $ 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
32415	He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million .
32417	Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space , and Salomon Brothers Inc. , whose headquarters is in the building , also plans to move shortly .
32423	The author of the futuristic novel `` 1984 '' invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is , anything negative about the policies and practices of the state .
32424	Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start .
32425	Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous , reassuring , and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better , safer or cheaper than they really are .
32432	-LRB- Another much-beloved saying , however , this one in plain English , holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it is a duck .
32436	These people used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone .
32439	At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , they are `` financial consultants . ''
32440	At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , Prudential Bache Securities , and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , they are `` account executives . ''
32442	Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified , broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products .
32443	It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle , do n't feel .
32445	The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product .
32452	This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships , many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
32453	They are still being sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks they had under the old label .
32455	In others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has changed .
32458	Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't .
32461	The mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
32463	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , for one , is still a favorite of widows , orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side , it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture .
32465	Larry Biehl , a money manager in San Mateo , Calif. , blames that on the advent of program trading , in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail .
32468	Before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects .
32470	To institutional investors or brokers , he adds , a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up .
32472	I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries .
32474	-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
32477	-- The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans -LRB- the Brady Plan -RRB- .
32478	-- The banks will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy , they have no alternative but to go along .
32481	Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
32482	Separately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
32484	For the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period .
32487	When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the chance .
32488	Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony .
32489	And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
32490	Not only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market value of the company .
32493	But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross , would empathize and let the producers go , knowing the Sony offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . ''
32495	Last week , following fruitless settlement talks , Warner , now merging with Time Inc. , filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters .
32496	Sony promptly countersued , charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business .
32497	The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides : As one Sony executive puts it , `` It 's World War III . ''
32500	Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York .
32503	Yet , they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood .
32505	That is a skill Sony badly needs -- and Warner is loath to lose .
32506	Although Columbia had a good summer with `` Ghostbusters II '' and `` When Harry Met Sally , '' rivals such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office .
32507	After five years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , Columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits .
32508	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected .
32509	Their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them .
32510	Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple . ''
32511	It falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing .
32512	With MGM\/UA 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success .
32514	In that case , Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production .
32516	On that film , which is to start shooting in a few months , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script .
32520	Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure .
32522	`` But by and large this company has only been profitable . ''
32523	He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia .
32525	Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing .
32527	Mark Johnson , the producer of `` Rainman , '' chimes in : `` He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority ... .
32529	Mr. Peters , on the other hand , has fewer fans in Hollywood , and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully .
32535	He came to produce her records and her movies -- `` A Star Is Born '' and `` The Main Event . ''
32536	Thrice married but now single , Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of `` Batman . ''
32538	But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team , Hollywood associates say .
32540	`` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . ''
32541	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way .
32542	Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film .
32546	They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers .
32547	When Roger Birnbaum , an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s , left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio , they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop , including `` Rainman '' and `` Batman . ''
32548	Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner .
32549	`` I was upset with Roger , I fumpered and schmumpered , '' says Mr. Peters .
32550	`` But he wanted to pursue his own dream , and he went . ''
32552	The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive , '' adds Mr. Birnbaum , who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co .
32553	`` Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone .
32554	Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific ... . ''
32555	Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey , which became `` Gorillas in the Mist . ''
32556	He says , `` Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey .
32558	Universal Studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner .
32559	More recently , Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner , for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes , the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest .
32560	Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` Gorillas in the Mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work .
32563	-LRB- The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers .
32564	Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest . -RRB-
32565	It 's hardly astonishing -LRB- given the men 's track record -RRB- that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
32567	Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract .
32568	But though `` people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters , it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works , '' says Steven Tisch , a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber .
32569	`` This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- it s about whether the ink is red or black .
32570	In the case of Peter and Jon , the ink has been very , very black . ''
32572	Recruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo . ''
32573	In 1976 , he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` The Deep , '' and `` Midnight Express . ''
32575	While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive .
32576	Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear . ''
32580	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony .
32581	`` From the beginning , -LCB- they -RCB- knew we had a goal and a dream , '' says Mr. Guber .
32583	`` They always listened , but they never acted , '' Mr. Guber says .
32584	In 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman .
32585	In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\/UA .
32586	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio , and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros . ' President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal .
32588	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price .
32590	Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co .
32591	Meanwhile , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract .
32592	The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
32593	But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50 million in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million for each .
32598	In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter .
32601	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise .
32602	But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made .
32604	Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different .
32606	Moreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now .
32607	Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives , '' Mr. Daly said in his affidavit .
32608	Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia .
32610	During settlement talks , for example , Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks .
32611	In any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman . ''
32612	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner .
32620	The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions .
32626	The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors .
32629	They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .
32635	They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
32638	Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
32643	That includes more than $ 9.5 billion issued through August of this year , up sharply from $ 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987 .
32644	Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions .
32645	But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market .
32648	The process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
32649	The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
32650	Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
32651	Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
32652	Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says Craig J. Goldberg , managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
32654	Consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables .
32657	That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
32658	But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless .
32660	`` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . ''
32661	Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
32662	That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California .
32665	Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
32666	The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
32670	In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings .
32673	Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
32675	The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof . ''
32678	That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
32680	Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company .
32686	When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
32687	If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .
32692	That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
32697	`` A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds , '' says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. , an investment advisory firm .
32702	And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what he calls `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 :
32703	`` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time . ''
32714	By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate .
32717	Similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds .
32720	It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood .
32724	Journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 .
32725	Nearly half of the respondents -LRB- 47 % -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said it was worth $ 1 million or more .
32726	The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
32740	The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- about 31 % -RRB- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- about 15 % -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- about 22 % -RRB- .
32742	Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
32757	Health Care Property Investors Inc. said it acquired three long-term care facilities and one assisted-living facility in a purchase-and-lease transaction valued at $ 15 million .
32761	It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives .
32764	Moody 's said it expects Valley National , of Phoenix , Ariz. , to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio , and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets , and from high loan-loss provisions .
32765	Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
32766	That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
32767	`` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md .
32769	The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group .
32771	Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
32772	They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
32776	By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security , and are expected to spend $ 1 billion by 1992 .
32779	One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies .
32781	He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
32788	The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp .
32791	Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$ 866 million for Connaught , and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$ 942 million .
32793	The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid .
32795	`` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught , this accord would enhance research and development in Canada , '' said James Keffer , the university 's vice president of research .
32796	Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville , Calif .
32798	While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university , he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies `` not currently producing and marketing vaccines -LCB- who -RCB- can only promise this for some ... years in the future . ''
32800	Microsoft and other software stocks surged , leading the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks to its biggest advance of the year on breathtaking volume .
32801	Leading the pack , Microsoft soared 3 3\/4 , or 4 % , to a record price of 84 1\/4 on 1.2 million shares .
32803	The Nasdaq composite leaped 7.52 points , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 .
32805	The OTC market 's largest stocks soared as well , as the Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 10.01 , or 2 % , to 463.06 .
32806	The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 5.04 , or 1.1 % , to 460.33 .
32807	By comparison , the Dow Jones Industrials and the New York Stock Exchange Composite each rose 1.5 % .
32810	The transportation and insurance sectors each posted gains of 8.59 , with the transports finishing at 486.74 and the insurers at 537.91 .
32811	The Nasdaq industrial index climbed 8.17 to 458.52 , and the `` other finance '' index , made up of commercial banks and real estate and brokerage firms , rose 3.97 to 545.96 .
32813	Of the 4,346 issues that changed hands , 1,435 rose and 629 fell .
32814	Jeremiah Mullins , head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds , said both institutional and retail investors were buying .
32820	After the earnings were announced , he raised his fiscal 1990 estimate to between $ 3.80 and $ 4 a share .
32822	Among other software issues , Autodesk jumped 1 1\/4 to 42 , Lotus Development was unchanged at 32 1\/2 , Novell jumped 7\/8 to 30 3\/4 , Ashton-Tate gained 1\/4 to 10 5\/8 , and Oracle Systems rose 3\/4 to 25 3\/4 .
32831	Valley National said its $ 110 million provision for credit losses and $ 11 million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the Arizona real estate market .
32832	Additionally , Moody 's Investors Service said it downgraded Valley National 's senior debt and confirmed the company 's commercial paper rating of `` not prime . ''
32842	From my orange seat , I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series .
32843	It was five in the afternoon , but that was Pacific time .
32845	Even still , I did feel self-indulgent , and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons .
32848	But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the future , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event .
32851	Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it ?
32854	Thousands of us had paid $ 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia , its historical photographs of great moments in Series past , and its instructions , in English and Spanish , for filling in the scorecard .
32857	Players ran out on the field way below , and the stands began to reverberate .
32867	Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened .
32871	Fortunately , the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood .
32872	At the Stick , while the world shook , I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different .
32883	The wall behind me was slightly deformed , but the center had held .
32886	It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen .
32893	But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night , with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district .
32894	By then , our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers .
32895	Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant .
32896	In fact , the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience .
32897	The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters .
32898	The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway .
32905	In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week .
32907	The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages .
32911	Instead , he says , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver '' on Monday .
32912	As Mr. Rivkin explains it , `` We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market .
32915	Both before and after the Friday plunge , Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .
32916	Sheldon B. Lubar , chairman of Lubar & Co. , and John L. Murray , chairman of Universal Foods Corp. , were elected to the board of this engine maker .
32917	They succeed Robert W. Kasten and John R. Parker , who reached the mandatory retirement age .
32921	Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation .
32923	`` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . ''
32924	A lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers .
32925	Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit .
32927	The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation .
32929	The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week .
32934	Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .
32935	`` When the going gets rough , China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist .
32938	But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy .
32943	But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation .
32947	Output declined in several provinces , including Jiangsu and Zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and Sichuan , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .
32948	Production in Shanghai , China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8 % for the month .
32952	The 1986 tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill .
32958	Adds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . ''
32962	The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years .
32963	As part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB- calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating .
32967	Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions .
32971	Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees , he adds , `` Next year , every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door , on Danny Rostenkowski 's door . ''
32973	Just last week , a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities , companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes .
32974	`` It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good , '' commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings .
32976	The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation -LRB- write-offs -RRB- or investment credits , '' says Paul Huard , a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers .
32982	But Sotheby 's , Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs .
32986	In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others .
32987	The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes .
32988	Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible .
32991	It appears likely that , this year or next , some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted .
32992	Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created .
32995	They wanted reform and they got a revolution , '' says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison -LRB- R. , Ohio -RRB- .
32998	One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School .
32999	`` I 'm too old to waste a weekend , but that 's what I did , '' the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans .
33003	Load factor , or percentage of seats filled , climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % , even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters .

33014	The result , `` Poodle Springs '' -LRB- Putnam 's , 288 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is an entertaining , easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle , full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color .
33017	His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring , a character who also appeared in Chandler 's `` The Long Goodbye '' and `` Playback . ''
33018	Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other , even in front of the Hawaiian\/Japanese houseman .
33020	He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye , and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him .
33022	Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life , Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds .
33023	The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes .
33027	At one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro .
33029	Contact lenses , tank tops , prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s .
33033	`` Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news , '' says Mr. Shioya .
33034	`` But one gets fed up with importing information and news . ''
33037	After a slick redesign , the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company , Keizaikai Corp. , the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services , book publishing and a tourist agency .
33038	Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line `` The Insider 's Japan , '' Business Tokyo 's October cover story was `` The World 's No. 1 Customer '' -- Japanese women .
33039	Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing , after making major investments in entertainment , real estate and banking companies here .
33040	Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market , including the New York-based investment banker Veronis , Suhler & Associates .
33042	`` Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries , '' said John Veronis , chairman of Veronis Suhler .
33045	`` It may not be weeks or months , but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable , they will move on a deal , '' he said .
33046	In recent months , three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including Nikkei Business Publications , Nikkei Home -LRB- no relation -RRB- , and Magazine House -- applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America , which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines .
33049	The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard , and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers .
33051	Susumu Ohara , president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. , publisher of the Japan Economic Journal , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine .
33053	`` Before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
33055	Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter , while Nynex Corp. , Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period .
33056	Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit .
33058	Revenue dropped 4.3 % to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.4 billion , reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector , long-distance carrier business and diversified division .
33063	`` On a truly comparable basis , we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company , '' said Jack MacAllister , chairman and chief executive officer .
33065	He said the company expects to be `` on target '' with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents `` a significant challenge . ''
33068	Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % , aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines .
33070	Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to $ 177.4 million from $ 144.1 million a year ago .
33075	At Nynex , net slumped 14.8 % , primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees , lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs .
33076	State and local taxes increased to $ 131.3 million from $ 99.1 million a year ago .
33078	Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units , it added .
33079	`` Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point , '' said William C. Ferguson , chairman and chief executive officer .
33081	Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition , particularly in the private-line market , took a heavy toll on earnings .
33084	Revenue rose to $ 3.31 billion from $ 3.18 billion , mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses .
33086	Southern New England Telecommunications , which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries , reported that net increased 8.1 % .
33087	Walter H. Monteith Jr. , SNET chairman and chief executive officer , said : `` Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue . ''
33088	Revenue and sales increased 7.5 % to $ 423.9 million from $ 394.4 million a year earlier .
33090	Cost and expenses for the quarter , excluding interest , increased 6.1 % to $ 333.3 million from $ 314 million the year before .
33094	Revenue was reduced $ 33 million by three extraordinary items : a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment ; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies .
33095	Excluding the one-time charges , the company would have posted earnings of $ 298 million , or 73 cents a share .
33097	`` This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals , '' said Sam Ginn , chairman and chief executive officer .
33098	Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about $ 13.5 million for the quarter ; toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion .
33102	Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to $ 336 million , or 65 cents a share , as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level .
33103	A charge of $ 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results .
33104	A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible .
33105	In the 1988 third quarter , the Chicago-based oil company earned $ 552 million , or $ 1.07 a share .
33111	Generally in the quarter , overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability .
33113	Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter , some industry officials say , but they believe chemical margins could worsen .
33115	Fina blamed lower chemical prices , reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns .
33116	It said net income dropped to $ 15.1 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 35.2 million , or $ 2.66 a share .
33118	Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $ 134 million from $ 319 million .
33120	Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $ 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $ 5 million , `` primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices , '' said Chairman Richard M. Morrow .
33122	But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply , to $ 12 million from $ 95 million .
33124	For the nine months , Amoco said that net income fell to $ 1.29 billion from $ 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded , operations produced essentially flat results .
33126	James F. Gero , former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. , and Richard J. Hatchett III , a Dallas investment banker , were elected directors of this medical-products concern , boosting the board to seven members .
33129	Concerns about the stock market , doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators .
33130	`` Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer , '' asserts Norman Abramson , president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. , an off-price chain .
33132	Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year , after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 .
33133	`` For the last two and a half years , retailing has been in a mild recession , '' says Carl Steidtmann , chief economist at the Columbus , Ohio , consulting firm .
33134	This year , many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil : Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code ; B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block ; Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block .
33136	Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. , May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. , which should do well .
33137	`` There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers , '' says Cynthia Turk , a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant .
33145	`` Traditionally , consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas , '' says Adam Strum , chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc. , which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail .
33149	He 's not predicting a blockbuster , but he is `` more optimistic than three months ago '' because employment remains strong and inflation low .
33151	Philip M. Hawley , chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. , expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3 % to 5 % over last year 's totals , both for his company and the industry in general .
33153	`` It is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes , '' says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells , `` but it is n't going to be a bust either . ''
33154	Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise `` pretty much in line '' with its year-to-date increases of between 8 % and 9 % .
33157	Of the 450 survey respondents , 35 % said they expect to spend less buying Christmas gifts this year than last year , while 28 % said they expect to spend more and 37 % said their gift budget would stay the same .
33161	Most will stay open late Saturday night and open their doors again Sunday .
33165	The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday , a surprising choice , but given the Swedish Academy 's past perversities , hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee .
33166	In Spain , anyway , the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years , the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct , vivid prose , beginning with `` The Family of Pascal Duarte '' -LRB- 1942 -RRB- .
33167	Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War , or left Spain when Franco triumphed , Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general 's side , no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds , murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land .
33168	Still , it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte , a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell : `` Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path , and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears .
33169	The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness .
33170	The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts . ''
33171	Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones , his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues , novels , short story collections and poetry .
33172	These days , he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books .
33173	The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958 , describing in his travel book `` Viaje a la Alcarria '' how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns , now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce .
33174	Of his 10 novels , `` The Hive '' -LRB- 1951 -RRB- , full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa , a foul-mouthed , broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth , used to be available in English , translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press , which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright .
33180	It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines : `` I 've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title ` Teresa de Cepeda , ' and in it I 've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which ... ''
33184	I 've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text . ''
33187	I do n't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in , but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment ... ''
33193	Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of $ 78 million , or $ 1.40 a share , in its fiscal fourth quarter , ended Sept. 30 .
33194	Because of the charge , Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and `` significantly lower results '' for fiscal 1989 .
33195	The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week .
33196	The company earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share , on revenue of $ 2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter .
33197	For fiscal 1988 , Ashland had net of $ 224 million , or $ 4.01 a share , on revenue of $ 7.8 billion .
33199	The charges consist of : a $ 25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland 's Riley Consolidated subsidiary ; a previously announced $ 38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $ 325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a $ 15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary .
33204	Undoubtedly Mr. Bush will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention , while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught .
33206	It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid , at all costs , being accused of meddling in the region .
33208	`` The -LCB- influence of the -RCB- U.S. is not being felt in Central America ; Washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy , and are divorced from reality , '' says Fernando Volio , a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister .
33212	Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega , eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president .
33213	The host , Costa Rican President Oscar Arias , did not invite Chile , Cuba , Panama or Haiti to the summit , which was to be restricted to democracies .
33219	However , relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business .
33222	Visiting Nicaragua , he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas .
33224	Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani ; Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes .
33233	This scheme would fit the Arias Plan , which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments .
33237	Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica , funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America -LRB- VOA -RRB- .
33241	It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America .
33245	A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64 % of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama , the U.S. will come to its defense .
33247	Mr. Daremblum is a lawyer and a columnist for La Nacion newspaper .
33249	Separately , the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately $ 1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt .
33250	That debt is part of the $ 2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August .
33251	Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to $ 39.8 million , or $ 1.53 a share , from $ 21 million , or 84 cents a share , a year earlier .
33252	Results for the quarter included $ 19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions , including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel , and $ 3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass .
33254	The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas , Nev. , and Atlantic City , N.J. , as well as a full quarter 's results from Harrah 's Del Rio in Laughlin , Nev .
33256	For the nine months , earnings fell 2.9 % to $ 99.1 million , or $ 3.86 a share , from $ 102.1 million , or $ 4.10 a share , a year earlier .
33258	The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December .
33260	Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation .
33261	The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices -LRB- expressed per $ 1,000 of principal amount -RRB- are as follows : 10 1\/2 % senior notes due 1994 at 101 % ; 11 % subordinated debt due 1999 at 102 % ; 9 3\/8 % notes due 1993 at 100 % ; and 8 3\/8 % notes due 1996 at 95.25 % .
33262	Holiday said its 15 % notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer .
33263	The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week , industry executives say .
33264	Although such a venture would n't match the `` fourth network '' created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. , MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions .
33265	Fox , which also owns six TV stations , provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates .
33266	Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month , named Premier Advertiser Sales , to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies , such as `` Star Trek : the Next Generation , '' `` Charles in Charge '' and `` Friday the 13th : the Series . ''
33270	MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $ 140 million .
33273	Currently , Fox supplies programs on Saturdays , Sundays and Mondays , although the company plans to expand to other weeknights .
33274	Jamie Kellner , president of Fox Broadcasting , said , `` We believe the partnership of Fox , its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow . ''
33277	`` We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations , '' he said , adding that Fox does n't `` appreciate '' another company attempting to usurp its station lineup .
33278	Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies , theatrical and made-for-TV ventures , probably on Wednesdays , sometime next year .
33280	Paramount and MCA , according to the broadcasting executive , plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays .
33281	The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit , which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles , San Francisco and Portland , Ore .
33289	Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and BanPonce Corp. -- agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $ 324 million .
33290	Under the agreement , BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash .
33294	The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico .
33296	Alberto M. Paracchini , currently chairman of BanPonce , will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary .
33297	Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July , in a cash and stock transaction valued at $ 50 a share , or about $ 293 million .
33298	BanPonce reacted cooly at first , but appeared to be won over , analysts said , by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .
33299	`` Banco Popular just kept waiting , '' said Edward Thompson , a vice president and analyst at Thomson BankWatch Inc. in New York .
33302	BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer , while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets .
33305	Richard Carrion , who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular , said the merger will result in a `` larger and stronger locally based bank . ''
33306	Mr. Carrion , who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank , added : `` We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks .
33308	The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island .
33311	Hit by higher costs and lower sales , Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43 % and full-year earnings will trail last year 's results .
33312	The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to $ 108 million , or $ 1.07 a share , from $ 190 million , or $ 1.87 a share , a year earlier .
33314	The company , which is in a costly modernization program , said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs , increased costs of materials , higher wages and an $ 11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America .
33315	In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of $ 950 million early this year , Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year 's $ 616 million , or $ 6.07 a share .
33318	Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December .
33319	For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85 a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46 a share , a year earlier .
33321	Millicom Inc. said it is one of two companies to receive a license to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan .
33325	Millicom said it would build and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB , part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden , and Arfeen International , Pakistan .
33327	At a shareholders ' meeting in London , the tobacco , financial-services and retailing giant said it received 99.9 % approval from voting holders for plans to spin off about $ 6 billion in assets .
33328	B.A.T aims to sell such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders .
33329	Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % , or about 153 million , of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
33331	The company said it acquired 2.5 million shares for 785 pence -LRB- $ 12.48 -RRB- each , or a total of # 19.6 million -LRB- $ 31.2 million -RRB- , from its broker , Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
33333	B.A.T said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today , depending on market conditions , but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22 , when it releases third-quarter results .
33336	Before the recent tumult in global financial markets , B.A.T officials , holders and analysts had expected a substantial part of the restructuring to be complete by the end of the first half .
33337	`` We are not in any hurry to sell '' Saks , Marshall Field or B.A.T 's other U.S. retail properties , said Chairman Patrick Sheehy .
33340	Company officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the U.S. retailing assets .
33344	Hasbro said it had net income of $ 31.3 million , or 53 cents a share , up from $ 18.1 million , or 31 cents a share , a year earlier , when it took a pretax charge of $ 10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system .
33346	The company cited sales gains at its Milton Bradley and Playskool units and in its international business for the increase in revenue .
33347	Alan G. Hassenfeld , chairman and chief executive , added that Hasbro 's new line of battery-powered racing cars , called Record Breakers , and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids , Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company `` in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season . ''
33348	For the first nine months of the year , Hasbro 's net income rose 33 % to $ 68.2 million , or $ 1.15 a share , from $ 51.3 million , or 88 cents a share , on a 3.1 % increase in revenue to $ 992.7 million from $ 963 million a year earlier .
33350	The athletic footwear maker said net rose to $ 49.9 million , or 44 cents a share , from $ 37.1 million , or 32 cents a share , a year earlier .
33352	Paul Fireman , Reebok chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` Our gains in earnings provide further evidence that the controls we have put in place and our sales mix are continuing to improve the company 's overall profit performance . ''
33354	In the first nine months , net was $ 140 million , or $ 1.23 a share , on sales of $ 1.44 billion .
33358	An outside spokesman for CML said the terms were changed to a minor extent but would n't disclose what those changes were .
33363	She said Wheeler Group was profitable but would n't give figures .
33365	Separately , Pitney Bowes said third-quarter net income gained 15 % to $ 62 million , or 78 cents a share , from $ 54 million , or 68 cents a share , a year ago .
33367	The company said the growth was led by its major operations , particularly mailing , shipping , dictating and facsimile businesses .
33370	State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse .
33375	In Sacramento , a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work .
33387	The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
33391	The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 , and as such , like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
33395	`` Unfortunately , there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes , and that is an earthquake , '' said Burch Bachtold , San Francisco district director for the transportation department .
33398	The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal .
33404	The debt consists of $ 50 million of 13 3\/8 % subordinated notes due 1998 , and $ 25 million of 9 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 .
33406	After years of quarreling over Bonn 's `` Ostpolitik '' , West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe .
33407	Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries , pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit .
33408	Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland , Hungary and , to a lesser extent , the Soviet Union .
33410	`` The change taking place in the Soviet Union , Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in -LCB- East Germany -RCB- , and that relations between the two German states , too , will get better , '' said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher .
33412	The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms , he said , is to create `` an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals . ''
33413	Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher , in separate speeches at the conference , appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland .
33414	Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland 's request for a $ 1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund .
33415	`` We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed .
33418	Meanwhile , the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an $ 837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested .
33419	The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced , indicating Congress 's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms .
33420	The legislation , approved 345-47 and sent to the Senate , establishes two enterprise funds , to be governed by independent nonprofit boards , which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland .
33422	In addition , a group of 24 industrialized countries , including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission , has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $ 1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank , while the EC plans $ 222 million in direct aid .
33427	West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms , including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment .
33428	An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg .
33429	Deutsche Bank AG , which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union , is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free-market economies .
33432	Mattel Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 73 % , to $ 38 million , or 76 cents a share , from $ 21.9 million , or 45 cents a share , a year ago .
33436	Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll , Hot Wheels cars , Disney toys and other well-known toy lines .
33437	The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year , such as Cherry Merry Muffin and Turtle Tots .
33438	For the nine months , Mattel net more than doubled to $ 58.9 million , or $ 1.19 a share , from $ 25.4 million , or 53 cents a share , a year ago .
33440	Mattel said the company 's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne , Calif. , headquarters resulted in a $ 13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit .
33451	Only a month ago he 'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest .
33456	Christopher Smith -LRB- R. , N.J. -RRB- , a pro-life leader in the House , suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states .
33458	When Democrats refused to budge , pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday , and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto .
33459	Amid charges of `` timidity '' on Panama and elsewhere , the president was n't about to offend his most energetic constituency .
33467	Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee , but she was talking to herself .
33469	They 're frightened by what they see in New Jersey , and especially Virginia , where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion .
33471	-LRB- In Virginia , Marshall Coleman and his running mate , Eddy Dalton , are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest . -RRB-
33476	Polls are no substitute for principle , but they 'll do for some politicians .
33479	Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him .
33481	Even the president 's doctor , Burton Lee , has said on the record that he 'd love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro-life test .
33484	Their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter , though HHS spends billions a year on both .
33491	-RRB- What about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters ?
33496	Within a few years , the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted , but not completely banned .
33500	The energy , natural resources and railroad concern had net of $ 137.4 million , or $ 1.35 a share , down from $ 165 million , or $ 1.44 a share , a year earlier .
33502	A year earlier , the company had profit from discontinued operations of $ 24.9 million from sale of a pipeline , a refinery and an interest in a second refinery .
33505	The company said its Union Pacific Railroad had a 3 % profit increase , despite a 14 % rise in fuel costs and a 4 % drop in car loadings .
33508	It added that higher revenue , strong crude oil prices and higher natural gas prices offset declines in production of oil , gas and plant liquids .
33509	In addition , the company cited cost-reduction moves and interest income .
33512	In the nine months , net fell 6.3 % to $ 427.7 million , or $ 3.98 a share , from $ 456.4 million , or $ 4 a share , a year earlier .
33517	The commission order named the following companies : Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California , a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor ; Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co. , units of Chicago Title & Trust Co. ; Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. , a unit of Richmond , Va.-based Universal Corp. ; and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. , a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp .
33518	Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit 's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co .
33519	The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states : New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Wisconsin , Arizona and Montana .
33526	Mark , an oil and gas concern , said the 15-year debentures are convertible before maturity at C$ 12.50 for each Mark common share , and can be redeemed at the company 's option , under certain conditions , after Nov. 30 , 1992 .
33528	The FADA real-estate package , with an asking price of $ 428 million , is comprised of 150 properties in Texas , California , Colorado , Arizona and Florida .
33529	It includes apartments , shopping centers , office buildings and undeveloped land .
33530	Mr. Seidman is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. , established to sell or merge the nation 's hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan associations .
33535	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
33538	Rated Baa-2 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
33539	Virginia Public School Authority -- $ 55.7 million of school financing bonds , 1989 Series B -LRB- 1987 resolution -RRB- , due 19912000 , 2005 and 2010 , through a BT Securities Corp. group .
33540	The bonds , rated double-A by Moody 's and S&P , were priced to yield from 6 % in 1991 to 7.10 % in 2010 .
33542	Bonds due 1991-1996 carry 6.70 % coupons and bonds due 1997-2000 carry 6 3\/4 % coupons .
33546	St. Johns River Water Management District , Fla. -- $ 50,005,000 of land acquisition revenue bonds , Series 1989 , due 1990-2000 , 2003 , 2006 and 2009 , tentatively priced by a Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. group to yield from 6 % in 1990 to about 7.03 % in 2003 .
33548	The $ 11,775,000 of term bonds due 2006 and the $ 13,865,000 of term bonds due 2009 are n't being formally reoffered .
33550	The bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P .
33556	The offerings bring Freddie Mac 's 1989 Remic issuance to $ 32.6 billion and its total volume to $ 46.5 billion since the program began in February 1988 .
33570	Each 1,000 mark and 10,000 mark bond is convertible from Nov. 27 , 1989 , to March 21 , 1995 , at a price to be determined when terms are fixed Oct. 25 .
33577	The debentures will be available in book-entry form only in a minimum amount of $ 5,000 and additional increments of $ 5,000 .
33582	The products range from computer-edited , personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
33588	A new product , NewsEdge , carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
33590	One early user , David Semmel , a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data , says he uses it to track takeover developments .
33591	He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover , acquisition , acquire , LBO , tender , merger , junk and halted .
33595	But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
33598	NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases .
33605	`` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president .
33606	The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a base cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
33609	It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
33611	If a customer asks for stories about `` IBM , '' the computer will also supply stories that mention `` I.B.M. , International Business Machines , or Big Blue , '' Mr. Amram says .
33613	It compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
33617	`` The computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one .
33618	Computer picking is n't perfect , '' says Harvey Golomb , president and founder of Pinpoint .
33620	Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base , Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
33621	Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night .
33623	So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
33624	`` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
33625	Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
33626	The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days .
33627	Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product `` so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week . ''
33636	A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay $ 404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly , the company 's former head of high-yield , high-risk junk-bond trading and sales .
33637	It also awarded $ 196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and $ 69,105 in fees to the two men 's attorneys .
33638	The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988 , but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract .
33641	Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year ; in August it paid $ 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief , Harold Bachman .
33642	That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash .
33647	American Brands Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 13 % , reflecting strong gains in its tobacco and distilled spirits businesses .
33648	The company , which also has businesses in life insurance , office products and hardware , and home-improvement products , said net income rose to $ 166.4 million , or $ 1.71 a share , from $ 146.8 million , or $ 1.53 a share , a year earlier .
33649	Year-earlier results for the quarter and the nine months were restated to reflect a change in accounting standards .
33650	Revenue declined 2 % , to $ 3.06 billion from $ 3.13 billion , because of the sale of Southland Life in March , and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on overseas results .
33653	In the first nine months , net rose 1.5 % , to $ 458.8 million , or $ 4.76 a share , from $ 452 million , or $ 4.50 a share , a year earlier .
33654	The year-earlier period included $ 40.1 million , or 41 cents a share , from discontinued operations .
33656	The average number of shares outstanding rose 2 % in the third quarter but was down 4 % for the nine months .
33662	But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday , and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday .
33664	It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds .
33665	Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post .
33666	BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics .
33667	Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation .
33668	Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir , for backing down on the elections , and at Shamir 's rival , Peres , for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker 's plan .
33669	Meanwhile , some U.S. officials fear PLO chief Arafat is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism .
33671	DARMAN'S MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt him in Congress .
33673	Darman now blames the clash on miscommunication , but House GOP leader Michel , who carried the offer to him , observes , `` I was speaking English at the time , and quite loud so I could be understood . ''
33681	COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the U.S. and Europe .
33682	Britain , France and Italy pull out of a proposal to build new NATO frigates ; the U.S. and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects .
33683	Defense experts say joint projects are increasingly squeezed by budget pressures and the desire to save domestic jobs ; some also fear rising protectionism as European unity nears .
33687	`` A woman ought to have a choice in cases where her life or health are in danger and in cases of rape or incest , '' she proclaims .
33691	Bush has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future Supreme Court nominees .
33694	Other conservatives thought to be on the administration 's short list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann , who was passed over for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department , and Marshall Breger , chairman of a U.S. agency on administration .
33698	Rep. Garcia , on trial for bribery and extortion , puts statements in the Congressional Record attributing missed votes to `` scheduling conflicts . '' ...
33699	A GOP Senate fund-raising letter from Sen. Burns of Montana is made to appear personally written , and its opening line is , `` Please excuse my handwriting . ''
33708	Isler Sailing International 's advisory board includes Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor ; Peter G. Diamandis , head of Diamandis Communications , and Joseph B. Vittoria , chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc .
33709	His steering committee includes other notable businessmen , including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney .
33710	`` We have the structure , people and plan , '' Mr. Isler said in a statement .
33711	Now , the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $ 3 million alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $ 25 million for a Cup challenge .
33716	`` If you do n't know what the rules of the game are , it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design , '' said Dana Smith , an official with Team Dennis Conner .
33717	The Conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined , Mr. Smith said , and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach $ 30 million .
33718	But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now , rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen .
33719	Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America 's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race .
33722	But I 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I 've seen -LRB- and smelt -RRB- in these parts .
33725	A community of abandoned farmsteads , failing businesses , and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one ... .
33728	We know they are dangerous , but if handled with care , their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
33733	Throughout the 1970s , Stamford school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural .
33734	Apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until 1980 , when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it .
33735	In 1986 , Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural -- and demanded he return it as soon as possible .
33736	Mr. Hoelzer , however , sued Stamford , claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it .
33738	The judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it .
33742	She said the mural `` preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
33754	On top of all this , corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio .
33768	He noted that the `` core inflation rate , '' which excludes food and energy , was also low at 0.2 % .
33769	Other news that weighed on the market : Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week ; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition ; the oil market turned weaker ; there was n't any investor demand for bullion ; and the dollar strengthened during the day , putting pressure on gold .
33770	Also , the analyst said , economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union , the principal gold and platinum producers , are being forced to continue selling the metals .
33771	Both are in great need of foreign exchange , and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said .
33776	That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week , mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper , a leading industrial metal .
33778	Some of this buying was by Japan , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea , Highland Valley mine in British Columbia , and the Cananea mine in Mexico , which are major shippers to Japan .
33779	The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing , but even if any of these mines begin operating soon , their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year , analysts note .
33788	Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well .
33791	Mr. Belli , like many other personal-injury lawyers , suspects that the earthquake , which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale , will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time .
33792	Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms , contractors and developers , as well as against local-government agencies .
33795	Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks .
33797	For now , says Laurence Drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association , `` the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not .
33801	Therefore , engineering firms , construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard , and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster , if negligence can be proven .
33802	`` My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting , '' says Stanley Chesley , a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer .
33803	From what he saw on television , Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 , which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters , suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever .
33804	He adds that `` they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault . ''
33805	The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it .
33806	`` We wo n't know until the smoke clears -- but yes , we 're looking into it , '' he says .
33807	Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage .
33808	Mr. Belli , who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night , says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse .
33816	Built into the statute are so-called design immunities , which are likely to protect government agencies , according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert , a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation , which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge .
33817	The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards , says Mr. Covert .
33821	Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday , and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks .
33823	He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge .
33825	The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical .
33828	The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name `` Deloitte '' by Deloitte , Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world .
33829	The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand .
33833	John C. Burton , an accounting professor at Columbia University 's Graduate School of Business , said `` there 's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England , where accounting predates the U.S. . ''
33834	Although accountants are n't noted as `` being deeply emotional , they really hold it all in , '' said Mr. Burton , former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
33836	Mr. Cook said that last June , the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger .
33839	General Motors Corp. , a Deloitte audit client , for example , has agreed to keep its annual $ 18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte-Touche firm , to be known as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S. .
33841	The defection of Deloitte 's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe , rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there .
33843	In New York , Harris Amhowitz , general counsel of Coopers , said Coopers `` was aware of the litigation , '' but he declined further comment .
33849	Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a `` test case '' for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .
33850	The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here , `` albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like . ''
33853	Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . ''
33860	He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $ 2 million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets .
33861	The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training , he added .
33863	In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo , many companies in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness .
33864	Some , particularly in West Coast earthquake zones , are dusting off their evacuation plans , checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes .
33866	Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days .
33867	Some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business resumption .
33868	Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions , hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly .
33869	That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way .
33870	Some businesses -- like Disneyland -- claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis , they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days .
33876	The ARCO memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work , such as solid shoes and `` heavy gloves to clear debris . ''
33877	It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter .
33878	Among the suggestions : Pantyhose and men 's ties could be used for slings , while removable wooden shelves might aid in `` breaking through office walls . ''
33880	Two months ago the company set up a toll-free number , based outside California , to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster .
33886	The Palo Alto , Calif. , computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday .
33887	Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help Bay area clients who called with computer problems .
33889	`` That means we can accept orders '' and begin getting back to normal , says Ms. Tharp .
33890	Prompted by an earlier California earthquake , as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower , Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent $ 75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters .
33891	Although officials of the savings and loan , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. , used some of their new plans and equipment during this week 's quake , they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas , not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open .
33892	`` Some people flat out did n't know what to do , '' says Robert G. Lee , vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at Great Western .
33893	As it turned out , bank employees were n't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts .
33896	Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food , oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16-story headquarters .
33897	The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months .
33899	Walt Disney Co. 's Disneyland in Anaheim , Calif. , stocks rescue equipment , medical supplies , and enough food and water to feed at least 10,000 visitors for as long as five days in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park .
33900	The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans using walkie-talkies , cellular phones , and a public-address system .
33901	The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and `` safe havens '' where people can be assembled away from major structures .
33902	Vista Chemical Co. , with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles , La. , `` prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico , '' says Keith L. Fogg , a company safety director .
33905	Because hurricanes can change course rapidly , the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages -- the closer a storm gets , the more complete the shutdown .
33913	Former Democratic fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert , whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators , has been granted court permission to sue the regulators .
33914	In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans , Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving , Texas .
33915	Mr. Gaubert , who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American , had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan .
33917	While under the control of federal regulators , Independent American 's net worth dropped from $ 75 million to a negative $ 400 million , wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution .
33918	Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act , which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees .
33919	Earlier this week , a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property .
33920	`` It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise ... that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration '' of Independent American , the court wrote .
33922	`` I do n't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred , '' Mr. Lowell says .
33926	The suit , which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $ 1 million , alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state 's human-rights law .
33927	Among other things , the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy .
33930	Kary Moss , an attorney with the ACLU 's Women 's Rights Project , said , `` They wanted a svelte-looking woman , and a pregnant woman is not svelte .
33931	They told her , ` We do n't hire fat people and we do n't hire cripples .
33936	`` The Odeon made a written offer to Marcia Levine on July 10 to return to work as the maitre 'd , at the same pay , same hours and with back pay accrued , '' he said .
33940	The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury .
33941	The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than $ 130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30 , east of Dallas .
33949	A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today .
33952	Five of the partners -- James W. Morris , Philip B. Morris , Robert M. White , Ann Adams Webster and Jacqueline G. Epps -- are opening a boutique in Richmond to concentrate on corporate defense litigation , particularly in product liability cases .
33956	Mayer , Brown & Platt , Chicago , added two partners to its Houston office , Eddy J. Roger Jr. , and Jeff C. Dodd ... .
33961	The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper .
33966	Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % , a reflection , in part , of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
33968	`` Next year , earnings will hold steady , but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising . ''
33971	In the quarterly report , Arthur Ochs Sulzberger , New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer , said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue .
33972	Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 .
33973	Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison , N.J. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs .
33978	Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group , which consists of the Times , 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune ; group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to $ 34.9 million from $ 34.5 million on flat revenue .
33981	Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds .
33983	Stock and bond investors were cheered by last month 's encouragingly low inflation rate .
33988	Since the 1987 crash , the industrials have soared more than 54 % , and the widely watched market barometer is about 4 % below its record high set earlier this month .
33989	The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues , but , unlike Monday 's rebound , was broadly based .
33991	The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52 , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 , its highest one-day jump in points this year .
33997	`` I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy , and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt , '' said Garnett L. Keith Jr. , vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America , one of the nation 's largest institutional investors .
34002	That , in turn , is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate , a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans , by half a percentage point , to 10 % .
34003	`` We 're not out of the woods yet by any means , '' said George R. Mateyo , president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. , Cleveland .
34006	Investors also are anxious about today 's `` witching hour , '' the monthly expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks .
34016	Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .
34018	In every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress .
34023	1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .
34024	2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- .
34026	If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic .
34027	If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies .
34030	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district\/state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits .
34033	First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .
34034	Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .
34037	The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .
34041	To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .
34043	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .
34045	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
34048	First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .
34050	Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .
34053	Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .
34054	An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .
34055	An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder -RRB- .
34059	A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .
34060	In sum , at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation .
34062	A House-Senate conference approved a nearly $ 17 billion State , Justice and Commerce Department bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1 .
34063	The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of approximately $ 1.25 billion is paid .
34064	The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments , but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988 .
34065	The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $ 156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor , Education , Health and Human Services .
34067	Reversing an eight-year federal policy , the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest , but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger .
34068	Mr. Bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House , but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill .
34069	The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State , Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990 .
34070	An estimated $ 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census , and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens .
34073	Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies , and an 18 % increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added $ 26 million in filing fees .
34074	In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances .
34075	The bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House .
34077	Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum .
34078	The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .
34079	Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger .
34082	An estimated $ 321 million is provided to maintain the program , but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed .
34083	The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year , and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center .
34084	The bill also provides $ 620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $ 80 million for peace-keeping activities .
34086	Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach , Calif. , thrift .
34087	Mercury , which has assets of more than $ 2 billion and 24 branches in California , said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation .
34090	Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors , fighting the urge to spend more , we 're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says , `` Stop me before I kill again . ''
34091	The Members know they 're doing wrong , but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions .
34094	It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy . ''
34096	`` Frankly , as I was walking back to get in my car , I heard many , many people ... opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in , '' he said .
34098	We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again .
34101	Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a President a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items that just go too far .
34102	Under the proposal , a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of `` rescissions '' to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes .
34103	Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority , but then a President could veto that rejection .
34106	Before 1974 , a President could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , funds appropriated by Congress .
34107	Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power , but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away .
34108	Today a President can still send up spending rescissions , but they 're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind .
34109	This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens , and naturally rescissions are almost never approved .
34110	In 1987 , President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill , but only 3 % of the spending total was approved by Congress .
34112	The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies , but the police -LRB- in the form of a President -RRB- would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy , as they do now .
34114	President Bush has endorsed the idea , and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past .
34115	We 're told Senator Pryor is n't yet a co-sponsor , but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions , they 'll sign up .
34116	Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake-ravaged California would total at least $ 2.5 billion .
34117	`` That is a minimum figure , and I underscore minimum , '' said House Speaker Thomas Foley -LRB- D. , Wash . -RRB- after conferring with California lawmakers .
34119	The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs .
34121	For the most part , major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
34123	The day before the quake , Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills .
34126	Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity , but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate .
34127	City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings , but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled .
34128	Among the city 's banks , Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open .
34129	The closed branches , in San Francisco , Hayward , Santa Clara and Santa Cruz , sustained structural damage .
34131	Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America 's Concord office , and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles , the bank said .
34139	That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished , peeled business facades south of Market Street , and houses in the city 's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations .
34140	Many streets and sidewalks buckled , and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured .
34141	The federal funds would go to a range of programs , including the Federal Emergency Management Agency , highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration , according to Rep. Vic Fazio -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .
34143	It is likely to get as much as $ 800 million initially in additional funds , and eventually could get more than $ 1 billion , according to Mr. Fazio , a member of the House Appropriations Committee .
34147	He added that the Office of Management and Budget , the Transportation Department and other agencies are `` developing longer-term legislation '' that should be ready soon .
34148	Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges .
34151	The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures .
34152	Its neighbor , the De Young Museum , totaled $ 3 million to $ 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture .
34153	The city 's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls , and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor .
34154	The ground along the Embarcadero the street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake , wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers .
34155	At San Francisco International Airport , shock waves wrecked the control tower , knocking down computers and shattering glass .
34161	At Fireman 's Fund Corp. , a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake , and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area .
34164	Fireman 's is part of a $ 38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge , which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income .
34168	For interstate highways , the federal share normally would drop to 90 % of the cost of repairs , and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost .
34170	Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands , according to an aide to Rep. Fazio .
34172	Lines will be available 24 hours a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone .
34173	Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks .
34174	Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily .
34176	The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem .
34177	Moreover , state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours .
34179	`` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . ''
34180	Most of San Francisco 's tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel 's offers of rate cuts .
34182	The Westin St. Francis hotel , which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire , currently is less than 50 % occupied .
34185	Gerald F. Seib and Joe Davidson in Washington contributed to this article .
34188	There are no easy choices in Cambodia , but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia .
34190	The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime , the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk , and the Khmer Rouge .
34193	The usual problem with including communists in `` interim '' coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else .
34195	Within two years , the moderates were exiled or in prison , Nicaragua had gone communist , and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors .
34197	Even Mao Tse-tung 's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller , non-communist parties .
34199	It 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government , but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear .
34200	That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge .
34201	The Hun Sen regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building Cambodia 's equivalent of the Berlin Wall near the Thai border .
34203	These utopians caused the deaths -- by starvation , disease or execution -- of well over one million Cambodians .
34210	But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years , and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia .
34214	It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following : Fight viciously enough and the U.S. , under the banner of pragmatism , might eventually help negotiate your way to victory .
34215	U.S. diplomacy has done it before , and it will likely do it again .
34216	The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia 's non-communists .
34219	At the very least , the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents .
34220	When that day comes , it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor .
34221	Michael F. Harris , 53 , was named executive vice president , North America , for the Financial Times , the business newspaper published by this company that also has interests in book publishing , fine china , oil services and investment banking .
34223	He takes additional responsibility for newspaper sales and distribution of the Financial Times in North America .
34224	Laurance V. Allen , 44 , who had been director for North America , resigned to pursue other business interests and do some consulting .
34225	Cipher Data Products Inc. posted a net loss of $ 14.2 million , or 97 cents a share , for its fiscal first quarter , compared with net income of $ 3.8 million , or 27 cents a share , a year ago .
34227	Cipher Data , a San Diego maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives , said the loss included reserves of $ 3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring .
34229	It is eliminating the positions of president and chief operating officer , formerly held by Edward L. Marinaro .
34230	Cipher Data said Mr. Marinaro consequently has resigned from those posts and from the company 's board .
34232	FileNet Corp. , Costa Mesa , Calif. , said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about $ 1.8 million , or 17 cents a share , because of a $ 2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of California .
34235	FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract , but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute .
34236	The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet system installed earlier this year .
34238	FileNet noted that it had cash and marketable securities totaling $ 22.5 million on Sept. 30 , and stockholders ' equity is $ 60.1 million .
34240	Clinton Gas Systems Inc. said it received a contract from Timken Co. , Canton , Ohio , to manage the natural gas purchasing , scheduling and transportation activities for Timken 's seven Ohio and two Pennsylvania plants .
34241	Clinton and Timken agreed not to disclose the value of the contract .
34242	Timken , a producer of bearings and specialty steel , already buys gas from Clinton .
34244	Manufacturers frequently do n't have anyone who is a specialist in natural gas , Clinton said , and a specialist such as Clinton can save them substantial amounts of money .
34245	The scene opens with pinstripe-suited executives -- Easterners , obviously -- glued to cellular phones and hightailing it out of town in chauffeur-driven limousines .
34246	`` The carpetbaggers , '' snorts the narrator with a Texas twang , `` have packed their bags and went . ''
34250	As the ad 's tone implies , the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days , and Lone Star is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that .
34251	From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders .
34252	While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times .
34253	That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .
34254	In the past , writes Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow , outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the `` right '' Texas attitudes and `` of course they had to be dipped for parasites . ''
34257	North Carolinians , New Yorkers , Californians , Chicagoans and Ohioans own Texas banks .
34266	In developing that theme at Interpublic Group of Cos . ' Lintas : New York unit , account supervisor Lisa Buksbaum says she made a `` couple of phone calls '' to Dallas ad friends and reported her `` findings '' to a team of writers .
34268	`` You know , '' she says , `` stereotypical stuff like armadillos , cowboys and football . ''
34269	Not exactly sophisticated market research , but who cares as long as the campaigns work .
34271	Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc. , Dallas , tells of the Texan who saw the agency 's tear-jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B. -- complete with the state 's anthem -- and promptly invested $ 100,000 in the thrift 's CDs .
34276	The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company 's ` Texasness , ' pointing out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying to be more Texan than Texans .
34277	Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like `` Connecticut and Long Island , '' sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet , a division of General Motors Corp .
34285	Commercials will highlight heart-rending scenes of Texas and chest-swelling , ain't-it-great-to-be-a-Texan music .
34288	A video sent to association members , featuring shots of the Alamo , cowboys , fajitas and a statue of Sam Houston , does n't mince words .
34290	`` So , do n't come and try to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat . ''
34306	Basketball star Michael Jordan and singer Randy Travis have also agreed to appear in ads .
34307	Dell Computer Corp. , squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line , said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts .
34308	Although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $ 385 million for the year ending Jan. 28 , 1990 , earnings are expected to be 25 cents to 35 cents a share , down from previous estimates of 50 cents to 60 cents .
34309	Earnings for fiscal 1989 were $ 14.4 million , or 80 cents a share , on sales of $ 257.8 million .
34310	Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31 , are expected to be released the third week of November , according to Michael Dell , chairman and chief executive officer .
34311	Mr. Dell said he does n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth quarter , but said third-quarter earnings could be as low as four cents a share .
34312	In the third quarter last year , Dell had net income of $ 5 million , or 26 cents a share , on sales of $ 75.2 million .
34314	Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably Intel Corp. 's newest chip , the 486 -- but others apparently have been caused by Dell 's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources .
34317	Product delays , however , have left Dell buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers , as powerhouse competitors Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. price their PCs more aggressively .
34318	The result has been thinner margins , which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion .
34320	But that has been the key to Compaq 's success , he adds , whereas Dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy .
34322	TransAtlantic Holdings PLC , a British-based , South African-controlled financial services investment group , and France 's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC .
34323	In a joint statement , the two companies , whose combined holdings equal 52.7 % of Sun Life 's ordinary shares , said their agreement is aimed at reducing `` the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that has resulted from two major shareholders owning '' a controlling interest in the company .
34325	In return , the agreement would force UAP to buy TransAtlantic 's 29.8 % holding in Sun Life or sell its 22.9 % stake to TransAtlantic at a price set by Transatlantic .
34326	Pride Petroleum Services Inc. said it agreed to buy well-servicing assets of two companies and expects to report higher third-quarter revenue and earnings .
34327	In the year-earlier quarter , the well-servicing contractor had net income of $ 319,000 , or 3 cents a share , on revenue of about $ 15 million .
34329	Separately , the Houston concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in New Mexico and California .
34330	It did n't disclose specifics but said it expects to complete the purchases by Nov. 1 .
34333	Net for the oil-field services and electronic measurements and systems concern rose to $ 114.2 million , or 48 cents a share , from $ 112.2 million , or 42 cents a share , a year earlier .
34336	But excluding businesses acquired or sold , revenue was flat at about $ 1.24 billion .
34337	Nine-month net fell 9.5 % to $ 323.4 million , or $ 1.36 a share , from $ 357.2 million , or $ 1.32 a share , a year earlier .
34339	This year 's nine-month results include gains of $ 13 million , or five cents a share , from the sale of Schlumberger 's defense systems business , and $ 22 million , or nine cents a share , from an award by the IranU.S . Claims Tribunal .
34340	The year-earlier nine months include a gain of $ 35 million , or 13 cents a share , from sale of the company 's Electricity Control & Transformers division .
34341	NEW ENGLAND CRITICAL CARE Inc. offered $ 35 million in convertible subordinated debentures through Morgan Stanley & Co. and Prudential-Bache Capital Funding .
34344	Proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes , including expansion of the company 's operations .
34352	The group has n't forecast full-year earnings for 1989 , although it said that its first-half results are n't a good indication because of one-time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations .
34353	Tuesday 's earthquake will depress local real-estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider expanding in or relocating to the Bay Area and California , real-estate and relocation specialists said .
34355	But real-estate experts and brokers said the quake undoubtedly will drag down prices in neighborhoods built on less stable ground , especially in the Bay Area .
34357	This is n't going to help , '' said Kenneth T. Rosen , chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley .
34362	Yesterday , the city demolished two dwellings in the district because of severe structural damage and said as many as 19 of the district 's 350 dwellings might have to be razed .
34365	Neither she nor other real-estate executives and brokers could project how much less Marina properties might bring , but she said the two-tier price structure would affect prices `` for a while . ''
34368	But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state .
34370	Mr. Renzas , among others , said the quake will prod companies in certain industries , like semiconductors , computers and aerospace , to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California .
34371	Because of the quake threat , `` some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere , '' he said .
34375	NATIONWIDE HEALTH PROPERTIES , Pasadena , Calif. , said it would n't pay its fourth-quarter dividend , despite a 44 % increase in third-quarter earnings , to $ 3.5 million , or 42 cents a share .
34377	A year earlier , Nationwide Health earned $ 2.4 million , or 29 cents a share .
34380	Nationwide Health said it has `` numerous financing activities '' under way to remedy the problem and will make up the dividend payment later if possible .
34381	Aussedat Rey S.A. , a French paper producer , said it concluded an agreement with Japan 's Fuji Photo Film Co. that will allow Aussedat Rey to manufacture and sell thermal paper using Fuji technology .
34382	Aussedat Rey is a leading French maker of copying and electronic printing paper .
34385	Aussedat Rey 's move follows similar technology-licensing agreements between Japanese producers of thermal paper and European paper groups .
34386	W.R. Grace & Co. , New York , said its earnings for the third quarter nearly doubled as a result of a $ 114.4 million pre-tax gain from restructuring its energy operations and other adjustments .
34387	Net income rose to $ 97.9 million , or $ 1.15 a share , from $ 50.5 million , or 60 cents a share , a year earlier .
34389	The gain resulted from the sale of Grace Equipment Co. , the initial public offering of a one-sixth interest in Grace Energy Corp. and an adjustment in the carrying value of certain natural resource assets not part of Grace Energy .
34390	The international specialty chemical company 's earnings were hurt by an accrual for stock-appreciation rights that reflected a 19 % increase in the stock price , and higher interest expenses .
34396	The company , founded and controlled by Harbanse Doman , its chairman and president , said the purchase would make it Canada 's 10th largest forest products company .
34397	Under terms of the transaction , which was proposed in June , Doman said it acquired International Forest Products Ltd. 's 22 % stake in Western Forest , and Western Forest , in a related transaction , bought back a 22 % interest in the company from Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd .
34400	International Forest , Western Forest , and Fletcher Challenge Canada are Vancouver-based forest products concerns .
34401	The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba .
34402	The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces , federal officials said .
34403	The federal government initiative follows a recent Canadian Supreme Court decision that held that the major telephone companies in Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority .
34404	Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in Quebec , Ontario , British Columbia and the Northwest Territories .
34405	The governments of Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies .
34407	Amdura Corp. said its bank group , led by Chicago-based Continental Bank , agreed to extend its $ 40 million bridge loan until March 31 , 1990 , and gave it a new $ 30 million credit line .
34408	Under terms of the loan agreement , Amdura said it will omit the next quarterly dividends on its Series A , B , C and D preferred shares , which are due Nov. 15 .
34413	Amdura , a Denver hardware and automotive distributor , said the new credit agreement will provide the working capital needed to meet ongoing requirements .
34414	Three savings-and-loan institutions in Kansas and Texas were added to the Resolution Trust Corp. 's conservatorship program after federal regulators declared the thrifts insolvent and named the RTC their receiver .
34415	The deposits , assets and certain liabilities of the three thrifts were transferred to newly chartered federal mutual institutions .
34416	The three institutions are : Mid Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association , Wichita , which had $ 830.5 million in assets ; Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association of McAllen , McAllen , Texas , with $ 582.6 million in assets ; and Surety Savings Association , El Paso , with $ 309.3 million in assets .

34419	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved the assumption of Century 's deposits and fully secured liabilities by a newly chartered subsidiary of Valley Capital Corp. , Las Vegas .
34420	The new institution is also called Century Bank , and the failed bank 's five offices will reopen today .
34422	The newly chartered bank will assume about $ 125.7 million in 10,300 deposit accounts and pay the FDIC a purchase premium of $ 2.9 million .
34423	It also will buy about $ 91.7 million of assets , and the FDIC will advance $ 31.8 million to the assuming bank .
34426	The rescue operation will consist of a capital boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds .
34428	This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale .
34430	International Business Machines Corp. and MCA Inc. said they agreed to sell their Discovision Associates joint venture to U.S. units of Pioneer Electronic Corp. for $ 200 million .
34431	The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical-disk recording technology .
34432	IBM and MCA formed Discovision in 1979 to make laser-read optical products .
34434	After reportedly investing $ 100 million in the business , Discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo-based Pioneer , among others .
34435	Discovision now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks , audio disk players , videodisks and videodisk players .
34436	It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices .
34437	James N. Fiedler , president of Discovision and a vice president of MCA , said that IBM and MCA had n't planned to sell the joint venture , which is now profitable , but that Pioneer approached Discovision earlier this year .
34439	The agreement is contingent on certain government approvals and should be completed later this year .
34440	Tokyo stocks closed higher in moderately active but directionless trading as the recent anxiety in world stock markets continued to fade .

34450	Having survived both last Friday 's 6.9 % Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the San Francisco Bay area earthquake , Tokyo market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal .
34451	Hiroyuki Murai , general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities , said that after looking at the reasons for Friday 's Wall Street plunge , participants realized that the Tokyo and New York markets have different economic fundamentals .
34453	Yoshiaki Mitsuoka , head of the investment information department at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management , said that if New York stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range , the Tokyo market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year .

34472	Dealers said the market was underpinned by a squeeze in FT-SE 100 stocks , particularly among market-makers seeking shares that had been hit hard in recent weeks , such as retailers and building-related concerns .
34473	But despite the flurry of interest in those shares , dealers said , the market remains nervous about Wall Street 's volatility and high U.K. interest rates .
34474	U.K. money supply figures for September , released yesterday , showed continued growth in corporate and personal lending , which will keep pressure on the government to maintain tight credit .
34478	Another active FT-SE 100 stock was clothing and furniture retailer Burton , which gained 6 to 196 .

34502	Gold and silver broker Preston Semel asked a federal court to halt the Commodity Exchange from imposing a record $ 550,000 fine on his firm .
34504	The fine and suspension , announced in August , are the stiffest sanctions the Comex has ever ordered against one of its members .
34505	The Comex accused the 39-year-old Mr. Semel of `` fraudulent conduct '' and improper trading .
34507	Mr. Semel and his firm , Semel & Co. , have appealed the Comex decision and the sanctions to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
34508	The commission denied Mr. Semel 's request that the fine and suspension be delayed pending the appeal .
34509	The lawsuit states that unless the sanctions are halted pending an appeal , the broker and his firm `` will be irreparably injured and their business will be totally and permanently destroyed . ''
34510	Already the firm has paid $ 211,666 of the fine , the suit said , and it will have to liquidate additional assets in order to pay the rest .

34677	Eugene Sit , president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis , says , `` When we bought it , we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds -LRB- the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for Uncle Sam 's check -RRB- .
34679	He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate -LRB- down from about 14 % the past five years -RRB- and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future .
34680	That 's `` not bad , '' Mr. Sit says , but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 .
34683	`` The stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so , '' said one .
34685	It was above 33 , adjusted for a subsequent split , in 1987 , and has n't gotten much higher since . -RRB-

34694	Thomas M. Bloch , president and chief operating officer , says `` I would disagree '' that the tax business is mature .
34697	`` We 're still interested -LCB- in diversifying -RCB- , '' he says , `` but we 'd rather be prudent than make a mistake . ''

34741	Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , New York , the newly merged drug and health-care-product company , reported record third-quarter earnings for both companies in the merger .
34742	Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. , Princeton , N.J. , merged Oct. 4 , but the new company reported third-period earnings for both companies .
34744	Bristol-Myers said net income rose 15 % to $ 266.2 million , or 93 cents a share , from $ 232.3 million , or 81 cents a share , a year earlier .
34746	Squibb Corp. said net rose 17 % to $ 144.5 million , or $ 1.47 a share , from $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share .
34749	PPG Industries Inc. , hurt by softness in the U.S. automotive and construction industries , said third-quarter net income fell 5.5 % to $ 106.7 million , or 97 cents a share , from $ 112.9 million , or $ 1.03 a share , a year ago .
34751	The drop in earnings did n't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass , coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry , a major market for the company 's flat glass .
34752	Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased .
34753	The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in North America and Europe .
34754	But sale increases were offset by slumping sales in flat glass and fiberglass reinforcements , the company said .
34755	Also , chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives .
34757	Jefferies Group Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 4 % , to $ 2.2 million , or 35 cents a share , from $ 2.3 million , or 31 cents a share on more shares , a year earlier .
34760	For the nine months , Jefferies said net fell 39 % , to $ 6.8 million , or $ 1.07 a share , from $ 11.1 million , or $ 1.50 a share .
34762	Sony Corp. , New York , said its bids for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. have been cleared by federal antitrust regulators .
34763	The Japanese company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act for the $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia and the $ 200 million offer for Guber-Peters expired Monday .
34764	Sony has agreed to buy both companies , but is in a legal battle with Warner Communications Inc. over the services of producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters .
34765	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Sony also said two more suits have been filed opposing the company 's agreement to buy Columbia .

34799	China said the question of Taiwan 's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after China 's own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored .
34800	Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT , which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules .

34827	Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil , coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide .
34828	A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan 's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8 % if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year 's level of 300 million tons .

34837	Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo , Ohio , assembly plant for the first time since April 1986 .
34838	About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 , and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter , a Chrysler spokesman said .
34840	Sales of Cherokee , the best-selling Jeep , and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month .
34842	Even when it became clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations , Chrysler officials `` resisted '' cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are `` very profitable vehicles , '' the spokesman said .
34844	The incentives boosted sales for a while , but the pace had cooled by last month .
34845	The result : Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup , which Toledo also builds .
34848	Steve Lowe , general manager of Jasper , Ga. , dealership , said new rebates of $ 500 to $ 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales , but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks .
34850	Separately , Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models .
34851	Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected .
34853	GM said the assembly plant , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 .
34854	The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars .
34855	Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .
34856	The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet , but sales of the cars are off 9.6 % for the year , and fell a steep 34.2 % early this month .
34857	GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown , Ohio , and Janesville , Wis. , assembly plants , which build the Chevrolet Cavalier .
34859	The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks .
34861	Meanwhile , the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week , down 11.7 % from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week 's 142,117 car output .
34862	f - Includes Chevrolet Prizm and Toyota Corolla .
34867	First Fidelity Bancorp. , Lawrenceville , N.J. , reported a 24 % drop in third-quarter profit , because of a decline in earning assets , lower loan volume and tighter interest margins .
34868	The bank holding company posted net income of $ 54.4 million , or 87 cents a share , including $ 1.7 million , or three cents a share , in one-time tax benefits .
34869	A year earlier , net was $ 71.6 million , or $ 1.22 a share .
34871	The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of $ 96 million `` owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer , '' First Fidelity said .
34878	Coastal , a Houston oil and gas company , said it expects to begin operations in October 1990 .
34879	The company said it may install additional processing units at the refinery to produce higher octane gasolines and other products .
34881	Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors , from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment .
34882	A Coastal spokesman said the biggest expense will be to refurbish the refinery but would n't say how much that would be .
34884	Coastal said the refinery 's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel , 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel , 30,000 barrels of naphtha , 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil , 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock .
34885	Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was $ 19.8 million , or 79 cents a share , compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of $ 15.6 million , or 62 cents a share .
34886	Year-earlier net of $ 21 million , or 84 cents a share , included the results of Loral 's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions , which were sold April 27 to the company 's chairman , Bernard L. Schwartz .
34887	The defense electronics concern attributed the operating improvement to higher profit margins and lower net interest expense .
34894	Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year .
34895	Loral 's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was $ 36.4 million , or $ 1.44 a share , up 31 % from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier .
34896	Net income fell 8.6 % to $ 37.1 million , or $ 1.43 a share , from $ 40.6 million , or $ 1.56 a share .
34900	HealthVest said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans .
34904	In addition , HealthVest said Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default .
34907	HealthVest is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate , Healthcare International Inc. , has failed to make about $ 10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August .
34911	Storage Technology Corp. had net income of $ 8.3 million , or 32 cents a share , for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29 , almost 15 times the $ 557,000 , or two cents a share , it posted for the year-ago period .
34917	For the nine months , Storage had net of $ 25.5 million , or 98 cents a share , including an $ 11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit .
34918	Net was up 69 % from $ 15.1 million , or 57 cents a share , last year .
34921	Three companies , Esso Resources Canada Ltd. , Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. , applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996 .
34926	They include Enron Corp. , Texas Eastern Corp. , Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co .
34930	It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of C$ 5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable .
34932	Shell , a subsidiary of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group , will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet , and Gulf , a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet .
34933	Combustion Engineering Inc. , Stamford , Conn. , said it sold and agreed to sell several investments and nonstrategic businesses for about $ 100 million , which will be used for reducing debt and general purposes .
34935	The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment , Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik , to the major shareholder in the companies , Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V .
34936	Combustion Engineering , which provides engineered products , systems and services for power generation , also sold Illinois Minerals Co. , based in Cairo , Ill .
34938	Assets of Construction Equipment International , Houston , were sold to Essex Crane Inc. , and the assets of Elgin Electronics , Erie , Pa. , were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
34942	That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression , and has n't changed much since .
34944	And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms .
34953	In addition , investors ' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady ; stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market , and not a shift in stock-holding preferences .
34957	The main components of the various asseet categories : Housing : Primary home , but not the land it 's on .
34958	Land and Other Real Estate : Land on which primary home is built , investment property .

34965	McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it sent a letter to LIN Broadcasting Corp. clarifying its revised tender offer for LIN and asking LIN to conduct `` a fair auction . ''
34969	McCaw is seeking 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern ; the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
34971	In a statement , Craig O. McCaw , chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw , said : `` We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth . ''
34974	LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest , or which are contiguous to those markets , unless LIN has an interest there or contiguous to it .
34977	If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years , McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it , and the independent directors will run the bidding .
34979	MCA Inc. said third-quarter net fell 6.3 % to $ 50.8 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 54.3 million , or 74 cents a share , a year earlier .
34981	The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter , including `` Parenthood '' and `` Uncle Buck , '' contributed to record revenue for its film unit .
34982	Both MCA 's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit .
34986	These items were partly offset , MCA said , by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit , a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes .
34988	In the nine months , net rose 35 % to $ 120.1 million , or $ 1.64 a share , from $ 89.2 million , or $ 1.22 a share , a year earlier .
34995	The effete Tyrannosaurus Rex Had strict Cretaceous views on sex , And that is why you only see him Reproduced in the museum .
34997	Helmsley Enterprises Inc. plans to close its company-owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies , according to individuals familiar with the New York firm .
34999	These include office and residential real estate giant , HelmsleySpear Inc. , and Helmsley Hotels .
35001	Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about $ 25 million annually , and has revenue , based on a standard 10 % commission rate , of about $ 2.5 million .
35002	The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed by HelmsleySpear and others .
35005	Helmsley 's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage , sources say , but the division was n't considered significant enough to the company to be restructured , particularly at a difficult time for the firm .
35006	Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder 's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire Helmsley organization .
35014	Down the street , a car pulls into the Shell station and is surrounded by black attendants .
35015	But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers ' office -- just about the largest building in town , save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school -- South Africa 's neat racial order is awry .
35016	A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes .
35017	White women serve tea and coffee , and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards .
35018	White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows .
35020	Not in the kitchen , or the storeroom or the book shop .
35021	`` If we want to have our own nation , then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves , '' says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. , son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers , founded in 1980 .
35023	The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa , with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races , blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress .
35025	The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands , a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- believe that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid , it 's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races .
35027	Their idea is to create a city , first , and then an entire nation -- without blacks .
35028	This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa .
35031	Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland .
35033	Thus , farmer Johan Fischer , his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease , crawls around under his planter , tightening bolts and fixing dents .
35036	Mr. Fischer plows his own fields , sows his own corn and sunflowers , and feeds his own sheep .
35037	Over at the fiberglass factory , four white workers assemble water tanks on their own , and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road .
35038	On Main Street , Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop , then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family .
35043	In their quest to perfect apartheid , the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny : The master ca n't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever .
35044	`` If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it , but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration , then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says Mr. Verwoerd .
35045	He is sitting in his living room , beneath a huge portrait of his late father , Hendrik F. Verwoerd , apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 .
35050	`` We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong , '' says Pieter Bruwer , the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer .
35051	`` We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly . ''
35054	Then , when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908 , the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town ; blacks could work there , but they had to leave at night .
35055	Today , Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads .
35056	Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks , and many houses and storefronts are empty .
35057	There are few factories and no mines .
35060	Still , complete and total segregation remains elusive .
35063	A young man called July -LRB- that 's when he was born -RRB- , who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office , points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly , `` We 're not allowed in there , that 's all I know . ''
35069	We need them and I thank God for them . ''
35075	The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics , Morgenzon will boom .
35088	After last Friday 's stock-market plunge , investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks .
35090	Now , with a semblance of normalcy returning , some advisers say it 's time for investors to take a hard , cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning .
35091	`` The market is sending nervous signals , '' says Peter J. Canelo , chief market strategist for Bear , Stearns & Co. , and it 's `` unwise '' to be overcommitted to stocks .
35096	We expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period , but we do n't think it will be ugly .
35098	And even those who say some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets .
35099	Any selling , they say , should be well thought-out , and executed gradually , during market rallies .
35102	`` Sell stocks that are n't doing well now , and that do n't have good earnings prospects , '' says Alfred Goldman , technical analyst at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons .
35103	`` Most people do just the opposite : They sell their winners and keep their losers . ''
35113	The economy is decelerating after six good years , and `` right now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later . ''
35115	Computer companies ; commodity cyclical stocks , like autos ; and retailing stocks , he says .
35121	UAL Corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to `` takeover stocks , '' says Mr. Canelo .
35123	`` There 'll be fewer and fewer deals . ''
35130	Mr. Canelo thinks the market will probably go higher , but `` will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there . ''
35140	If things have n't worked out that well , and sales wo n't hit $ 200 million until 1992 , it 's time to consider selling , he says .
35142	The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining .
35145	Robert A. Oswald , chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company , was elected to the additional position of executive vice president .
35146	In addition , Michael W. O'Donnell , executive vice president of a Columbia unit , was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company .
35149	This magazine and book publisher said three men were elected directors , increasing the board to 10 .
35150	They are : James R. Eiszner , 62 years old and chairman and chief executive officer of CPC International Inc. ; Robert G. Schwartz , 61 , chairman , president and chief executive officer of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. , and Walter V. Shipley , 53 , chairman and chief executive officer of Chemical Banking Corp .
35151	BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings , as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans , higher interest margins and negligible loan losses .
35152	For the quarter , BankAmerica said it earned $ 254 million , or $ 1.16 a share , compared with $ 190 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .
35154	All but eight of the 850 branches , which had some structural damage , reopened yesterday for business .
35155	Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday , a bank spokesman said .
35156	For the first time in nearly two years , BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters , but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors .
35157	Third-quarter profit was 16 % below the $ 304 million , or $ 1.50 a share , earned in the 1989 second quarter .
35161	Moreover , BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ 170 million , about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ 100 million in the year-earlier quarter .
35162	The provision rate was far above BankAmerica 's actual net credit losses of $ 24 million in the third quarter , compared with $ 18 million in the second period and $ 38 million a year earlier .
35164	That level is about the same as some other big banks , but far below the 85 % and 100 % reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co. , respectively .
35172	The 4.52 % net interest margin , or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings , was still markedly higher than the 3.91 % ratio a year earlier , and is among the best in the industry , analysts said .
35173	The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans , which jumped 31 % to $ 17.47 billion from a year earlier , and residential mortgages , which rose 25 % to $ 12 billion .
35175	For the nine months , BankAmerica profit soared 81 % to $ 833 million , or $ 4.07 a share , from $ 461 million , or $ 2.40 a share .
35177	Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel , with computers , robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other .
35178	As a result , if a problem develops on a production line , it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it .
35179	So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe , or anything in between .
35182	In Armonk , N.Y. , an IBM spokeswoman confirmed that IBM executives will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate .
35183	The industry executives said that , as usual with such broad announcements from IBM , this one will be part reality and part strategy .
35184	So it will take many quarters for IBM to roll out all the products that customers need , and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations .
35186	Still , consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient , and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market -- a market that Yankee Group , a research firm , has said may double to $ 40 billion by 1993 .
35189	We 'll have to wait and see '' how the plan develops .
35191	While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools , Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing .
35194	In addition , Hewlett-Packard , while a much smaller player , has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems .
35195	Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively : Gartner Group Inc. , a research firm , estimated the Digital gets 30 % of its revenue from the manufacturing market , and Hewlett-Packard gets 50 % .
35197	That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge , and IBM is the biggest player .
35199	The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing , CIM , seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition .
35200	Erik Keller , a Gartner Group analyst , said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM 's capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder , for instance , and may be able to prevent that from happening .
35202	In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips , for instance , a chip sometimes does n't melt , gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets .
35203	That can be expensive , because the problem may not be noticed for a while , and the sheets are typically thrown away .
35212	The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln-Mercury dealers -- as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort , which are sold under existing Ford divisions .
35213	The move to halt imports -- announced 29 years and 11 months to the day after Henry Ford II declared that the Edsel division and its gawky car would be scrapped -- kills the four-year-old Merkur brand in the U.S. market .
35217	The No. 2 auto maker 's new Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced , and Ford 's trucks are losing ground to their GM rivals .
35222	The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as Audi and Saab , which at least have clear brand images .
35223	Merkur , as an import on domestic car lots , suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp .
35229	Ford officials said they expected the two Merkurs would sell about 15,000 cars a year , and in 1988 they reached that goal , as sales hit 15,261 cars .
35239	This year , Scorpio sales plummeted , and at the current sales pace it would take Ford 242 days to sell off the current Scorpio inventory of about 4,600 cars .
35240	Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it proposed acquiring the 44 % of Soo Line Corp. it does n't already own for $ 19.50 a share , or about $ 81.9 million , after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year .
35242	The troubled Minneapolis-based railroad concern said the committee has the authority to hire financial and legal advisers to assist it .
35245	Canadian Pacific put its 56 % stake in Soo Line up for sale last year but could n't find any takers .
35246	Canadian Pacific , which has interests in transportation , telecommunications , forest products , energy and real estate , finally took its majority block off the market this spring .
35248	Canadian Pacific is Soo Line 's biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the U.S. railroad since 1947 .
35249	Canadian Pacific and Soo Line tracks connect at two points in the West on the Canada-U.S. border and the two companies operate a very successful Chicago-Montreal rail service .
35250	Separately , for the first nine months , Soo Line reported a loss of $ 398,000 , or four cents a share , compared with net income of $ 12.5 million , or $ 1.32 a share , a year earlier .
35253	Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 13.1 million , or 76 cents a share , based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
35254	The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of $ 1.5 million , or seven cents a share , based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
35257	Most of the expenses stem from the company 's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip , and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property .
35258	For the nine months , Golden Nugget reported a net loss of $ 11.4 million , or 69 cents a share , based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
35259	The year earlier , the company had a net loss of $ 4.3 million , or 20 cents a share , based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding .
35261	Separately , the casino operator said its board approved a plan to buy-back as many as three million common shares from time to time , either in the open market or through private transactions .
35263	John Uphoff , an analyst with Raymond James & Associates , said the results were n't surprising , and attributed the buy-back to management 's confidence in the Mirage 's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990 .
35265	Capital Holding Corp. said it requested and received the resignation of John A. Franco , its vice chairman , as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company .
35266	The company said Mr. Franco developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with Capital Holding Corp. 's Accumulation and Investment Group , which Mr. Franco headed .
35267	The group temporarily will report to Irving W. Bailey II , chairman , president and chief executive officer of Capital Holding .
35268	Mr. Franco , 47 years old , said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures , but that `` nothing is at a mature stage . ''
35270	Martin H. Ruby , a managing director of Capital Holding 's Accumulation and Investment Group , also resigned to pursue other business interests , Capital Holding said .
35271	Mr. Ruby , 39 , said that he had `` an amicable parting '' with Capital Holding and that he has `` a number of ventures in the financial-services area '' under consideration .
35272	He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with Capital Holding management , but that he was n't actually asked to resign .
35273	The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding 's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions .

35283	But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden .
35286	Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6 , 1973 , for the patent , which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to Hasbro Industries , then Eagle 's parent .
35287	Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead .
35289	Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed , cut , painted and eraser-fitted .
35291	Eagle 's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil .
35293	The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1 , No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils , which account for the bulk of the market .
35294	Artists and draftsmen need harder `` leads . ''
35296	It 's a trade secret how many were plastic , and most writers still do n't know what they 're using .
35297	H.F. Ahmanson & Co. , the nation 's largest thrift holding company , posted a 12 % earnings decline for the third quarter while another large California savings and loan , Great Western Financial Corp. , reported a slight earnings gain .
35298	H.F. Ahmanson , parent of Home Savings of America , reported third-quarter net of $ 49.2 million , or 50 cents a share , down from $ 56.1 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
35301	For the nine months , Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson had profit of $ 128.1 million , or $ 1.29 a share , a 4.6 % decline from earnings of $ 134.2 million in the year-ago nine months .
35303	Third-quarter spreads widened to the highest level in two years as loan portfolio yields rose and money costs declined , the company said .
35304	Great Western Financial said third-quarter profit rose slightly to $ 68.4 million , or 52 cents a share , from $ 67.9 million , or 53 cents a share , from a year ago .
35305	Great Western , based in Beverly Hills , Calif. , is a financial services firm and parent to Great Western Bank , an S&L .
35307	Margins are the difference between the yield on the company 's earning assets and its own cost of funds .
35308	But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company 's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain , the company said .
35309	Great Western 's provision for loan losses was increased to $ 27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with $ 21.8 million a year ago primarily as a result of `` continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside California . ''
35310	For the nine months Great Western posted net of $ 177.5 million , or $ 1.37 a share , a 5.9 % decline from $ 188.7 million , or $ 1.48 a share , in the year-ago period .
35313	The information company also cited the stronger dollar , the sale last year of its former Official Airline Guides unit and other factors .
35314	Net income rose to a record $ 155.3 million , or 83 cents a share , from $ 134.8 million , or 72 cents a share .
35317	Analysts said the results were as expected , but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses .
35319	For example , he noted , operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated , but nonoperating earnings of $ 14.6 million and a lower tax rate helped boost net income .
35323	The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed $ 18 million settlement of related lawsuits .
35326	Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research , Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth .
35327	It cited cyclical conditions in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units .
35328	For the nine months , net income rose 19 % to $ 449 million , or $ 2.40 a share , from $ 375.9 million , or $ 2.01 a share , a year earlier .
35332	Terms include a royalty arrangement , but details were n't disclosed .
35333	The computer equipment and financial services company said IATA , a trade group , will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world-wide .
35335	The package helps carriers solve pricing problems , such as how to react to discounts offered by competitors or what would be the optimum number of seats to offer at a given price .
35336	Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport , Pa .
35337	The new equipment , which will produce steel sheet with more uniform thickness and flatness , is likely to cost more than $ 20 million , the company said .
35338	When the company last considered adding the equipment two years ago , it estimated the cost at $ 21 million to $ 22 million , but a task force will have to prepare a detailed plan before the company can predict the current cost .
35342	Sir Richard is also a non-executive director at National Westminister Bank and NatWest Investment Bank Ltd .
35343	In the long , frightening night after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
35345	Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake , and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards , which link computers CB-radio-style , via phone lines .
35348	The quake knocked The Well out for six hours , but when it came back up , it teemed with emotional first-hand reports .
35350	The time is Pacific Daylight Time , and the initials or nicknames are those subscribers use to identify themselves .
35354	I was in the avenues , on the third floor of an old building , and except for my heart -LRB- Beat , BEAT ! -RRB- I 'm OK .
35355	Got back to Bolinas , and everything had fallen : broken poster frames with glass on the floor , file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor .
35359	I felt the temblor begin and glanced at the table next to mine , smiled that guilty smile and we both mouthed the words , `` Earth-quake ! '' together .
35361	This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .
35365	Endless seconds wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass .
35370	My younger daughter and I are fine .
35371	This building shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .
35372	Except for the gas tank at Hustead 's Towing Service exploding and burning in downtown Berkeley , things here are quite peaceful .
35383	I was driving my truck , stopped at a red light at the corner of Shattuck and Alcatraz at the Oakland-Berkeley border when it hit .
35393	I rode it out on the second floor of Leo 's at 55th and Telegraph in Oakland .
35401	My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
35409	Building on the corner severely damaged , so an old lady and her very old mother are in the guest room .
35410	Books and software everywhere .
35415	Did n't feel a thing , but noticed some strange bird behavior .
35424	No power , minimal phones , and a mess of mayonnaise , wine , and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People 's Co-op .
35425	The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals , and the mouse that 's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk .
35426	It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
35429	Then as things got rougher , we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down , and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm .
35430	Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short-term memory .
35431	Everyone looked calm , but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued .
35434	Power is back on , and UCSF -LCB- medical center -RCB- seems to have quieted down for the night -LRB- they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it -RRB- .
35440	I got home , let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head , as if someone were walking on the roof , or upstairs .
35441	Then I noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
35442	I realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs .
35443	Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet , the dogs came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .
35444	When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the house , waiting and praying for Merrill to come home , shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there .
35446	When I saw the pictures of 880 and the Bay Bridge , I began to cry .
35452	I was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients , a couple , and the building started shaking like crazy .
35453	It 's a flimsy structure , built up on supports , and it was really rocking around .
35454	The three of us stopped breathing for a moment , and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway .
35459	Biggest trouble was scared family who could n't get a phone line through , and spent a really horrible hour not knowing .
35462	Judy and I were in our back yard when the lawn started rolling like ocean waves .
35463	We ran into the house to get Mame , but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried to get to my feet .
35466	Books and tapes all over my room .
35467	Not one thing in the house is where it is supposed to be , but the structure is fine .
35468	While I was standing on the lawn with Mame , waiting for another tremor , I noticed that all the earthworms were emerging from the ground and slithering across the lawn !
35474	I guess we 're all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .
35475	It 's hard to accept that it 's over and only took 15 seconds .
35479	Flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight .
35482	I walked along Shattuck between Delaware and Cedar at a few minutes before eight this morning .
35483	Next to Chez Panisse a homeless couple , bundled into a blue sleeping bag , sat up , said , `` Good morning '' and then the woman smiled , said , `` Is n't it great just to be alive ? ''
35487	Georgia-Pacific Corp. , exceeding some analysts ' expectations , said third-quarter earnings rose 56 % to $ 178 million , or $ 2.03 a share , from $ 114 million , or $ 1.19 a share , in the year-earlier period .
35490	With strong prices in the company 's two major areas -- building products as well as pulp and paper -- analysts had expected a roaring quarter .
35493	One reason : efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the Pacific Northwest , constricting supply and forcing prices up .
35494	Another reason : strikes , both at Georgia-Pacific and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices , analysts said .
35495	For the nine months , Georgia-Pacific 's earnings increased 49 % to $ 504 million , or $ 5.58 a share , from $ 338 million , or $ 3.41 a share .
35498	The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a bill that would give the Transportation Department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs , despite a clear veto threat from the Bush administration .
35499	The 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after .
35503	Some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat .
35505	`` We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner , '' one Republican said , `` and now we 're out there dangling in the wind . ''
35507	But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs .
35508	Under the committee bill , the Transportation secretary would have 30 days , and an additional 20 days if needed , to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock .
35509	The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest .
35512	The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market .
35516	In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the secretary also said the bill `` would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources . ''
35522	It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers .
35524	Tokyo stocks , which rebounded strongly Tuesday , extended their gains yesterday , but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower .
35527	The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses .
35530	U.K. composite , or non-life , insurers , which some equity analysts said might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster , helped support the London market by showing only narrow losses in early trading .
35532	Dealers said the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions , caused by interest-rate increases last week and Wall Street 's 6.9 % plunge Friday .
35533	But technical factors , including modest gains in the value of the pound , helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier .
35534	Among composite insurers , General Accident rose 10 pence to # 10.03 -LRB- $ 15.80 -RRB- a share , Guardian Royal climbed 5 to 217 pence , Sun Alliance rose 3 to 290 , and Royal Insurance jumped 12 to 450 .
35536	Pearl Group rose 5 to 628 , and Sun Life finished unchanged at # 10.98 .
35539	B.A.T Industries fell in early dealings but recovered to finish at 754 , up 5 .
35542	The recent stock market drop has shaken confidence in the plan , but dealers said the shares fell initially on questions about whether Mr. Goldsmith 's highly leveraged bid will come to fruition .
35543	Trading was suspended in WCRS Group , a U.K. advertising concern , pending an announcement that it is buying the remaining 50 % of France 's Carat Holding for 2.02 billion French francs -LRB- $ 318.7 million -RRB- and expanding commercial and equity ties with advertising group Eurocom .
35546	Jaguar advanced 19 to 673 as traders contemplated a potential battle between General Motors and Ford Motor for control of the U.K. luxury auto maker .
35547	Tokyo 's Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 111.48 points , or 0.32 % , to 35107.56 .
35551	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section , which gained 41.76 Tuesday , was up 0.24 points , or 0.01 % , at 2642.88 .
35553	On Wednesday , shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations , traders said .
35555	The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar , traders said , and by the U.S. trade deficit , which widened by 31 % in August from the previous month .
35556	Traders and analysts said they did n't see any effect on Tokyo stocks from the California earthquake .
35557	The impact on Japanese insurers and property owners with interests in the San Francisco area is still being assessed , they said .
35559	With uncertainty still hanging over interest rates and the dollar , the market failed to find a focus that might lead to further investor commitments , they said .
35561	Interest rate-sensitive shares such as steel , construction and electric utility companies , which rose early in the week , saw their advance weaken yesterday .
35566	Kirin Brewery was up 100 at 2,000 , and Ajinomoto gained 70 to 2,840 .
35568	Shares closed lower in other major Asian and Pacific markets , including Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Wellington , Seoul and Manila .
35571	Elsewhere , prices surged for a second day in Frankfurt , closed higher in Zurich , Stockholm and Amsterdam and were broadly lower in Milan , Paris and Brussels .
35579	Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month , down 5.2 % from August , the department said .
35580	The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 , when the country was nearing the end of a recession .
35584	Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses , which had been climbing , dropped .
35589	In August , rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through September .
35594	Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August .
35597	The housing starts numbers , however , are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
35598	Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier , but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a $ 37 million after-tax gain .
35599	The securities firm posted third-quarter net of $ 66 million , or 64 cents a share , compared with a restated year-earlier loss of $ 3 million , or 11 cents a share .
35603	In the 1989 second quarter , Shearson had net income of $ 55 million , or 54 cents a share .
35606	The company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from marketmaking and trading for its own account .
35608	But industrywide trading activity slowed in September as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market .
35610	In the nine months , net fell 3 % to $ 106 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 110 million , or $ 1.05 a share .
35612	Two major drug companies posted strong third-quarter earnings , in line with profits already reported by industry leaders and analysts ' expectations .
35616	American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels .
35618	Sales of health-care products increased 6 % in the third quarter , based in part on strong sales of prescription drugs such as Premarin , an estrogen-replacement drug , and sales of the company 's infant formula .
35619	American Home Products said net income benefited from a `` lower effective tax rate , '' reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates , and additional operations in Puerto Rico .
35624	The company said net income was flat because of investment in research and development and costs related to launches of several products .
35626	Pfizer posted its largest gains in healthcare sales , up 3 % , and consumer products , up 23 % .
35627	Sales by the specialty chemicals and materials science segments were flat , and sales by the agriculture segment declined 5 % .
35628	In the health-care segment , pharmaceutical sales increased 4 % and sales of hospital products increased 1 % .
35629	During the quarter , Pfizer received federal approval of Procardia XL , a calcium channel blocker approved for both angina and hypertension , and Monorail Piccolino , used to open obstructed coronary arteries .
35633	In the period , the company completed the sale of its European cosmetics businesses , sold a majority interest in its Brazilian affiliate , and announced the reorganization of its over-the-counter drug businesses into a new unit , Schering-Plough Health Care Products .
35634	These actions did n't affect results because the gain on the sale of the European cosmetics businesses was offset by provisions relating to the Brazil divestiture and drug restructuring .
35635	U.S. pharmaceutical sales rose 15 % , led by allergy , asthma and cold products ; dermatological products ; anti-infectives and anti-cancer products ; and cardiovascular products .
35640	Swedish auto and aerospace concern Saab-Scania AB said it received a 250 million krona -LRB- $ 39 million -RRB- order from Swiss Crossair , one of Europe 's leading regional air companies , for five Saab 340B turboprop commuter aircraft .
35644	Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless , and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period ; the $ 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands ; the near - and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry , tourism , not to mention the human suffering .
35645	In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities , your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city .
35646	The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country .
35649	Your story was tasteless and insensitive .
35652	You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years -- a part of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some $ 38 million .
35655	Charleston is historic and aristocratic , as your reporter said , but not haughty , as he suggested .
35656	Charlestonians are instead indomitable and have contributed mightily to the culture and history of our country for more than 300 years .
35660	Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. said it agreed to sell its 10 % interest in Rocky Mountain Bankcard Systems for $ 18.5 million to Colorado National Bank of Denver and Central Bank of Denver .
35661	Colorado National is a unit of Colorado National Bankshares Inc. and Central is a unit of First Bank System of Minneapolis .
35662	Affiliated said it expects to record a pretax gain of about $ 18.5 million from the sale of the credit-card business , which should more than offset any reduction in the carrying value of real estate and real-estate loans on its books .
35664	The loan guarantee would amount to about $ 127.5 million , or 85 % of the cost of the aircraft .
35665	Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee , the Ex-Im Bank 's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees .
35669	President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina , who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos , or Pemex , one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies .
35672	And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment .
35678	We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital , '' he says .
35683	A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each $ 1 in sales , far above the industry norm .
35684	The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year .
35686	`` Whatever you tried to change , whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners , the big obstacle was the old union leadership , '' says oil consultant George Baker .
35696	About 9,800 technical workers , notably chemists and lawyers , were switched to non-union status .
35698	Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation .
35701	Pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company , but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $ 500 million a year .
35706	This year , for the first time , Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience .
35710	But Pemex 's courtship with private companies , and especially foreign ones , is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 .
35712	Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products .
35714	`` If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence , sooner or later we 're going to become victims of our own isolation , '' he says .
35716	MORE EXECUTIVES and their spouses are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount .
35718	Many couples `` are like ships passing in the night , '' a communications gulf that sparks problems on the job and at home , says psychologist Harry Levinson .
35719	His Levinson Institute in Belmont , Mass. , has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program .
35725	Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla , Calif. , has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years .
35726	`` No matter how competent and smart you both are , the relationship almost certainly will erode if you do n't have time to talk , to have fun and to be sexual , '' says Ms. Shaevitz .
35727	She urges client couples to begin a `` detoxification '' period , purging social and other nonproductive activities and setting time apart for themselves .
35730	HERE 'S ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor : Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions to save money , increase efficiency and boost morale , while only 8 % of American workers do .
35732	Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions , while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four .
35742	A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's 10 biggest challenges .
35747	But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds , like expense-account fudging and phone misuse .
35748	Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura , Calif. , thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism , conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts .
35751	Mr. Dalton also recommends that the chief executive establish a rumor control center and move swiftly to bolster morale .
35752	Consultant John Keller of Southlake , Texas , urges that top management adopt a `` tough hands-on approach '' with very tight controls and monitoring .
35756	A survey by Sirota , Alper & Pfau , a New York consulting firm , underscores the difficulty for top management in satisfying employees and investors on that score .
35759	But both see a common enemy : About 66 % of employees and 73 % of investors think senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie .
35760	Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between $ 130 million and $ 134 million .
35764	First City , which issues both MasterCard and Visa cards , has agreed to act as an agent bank .
35767	First City said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business , it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them .
35770	The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value , which stood at $ 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 , by more than $ 100 million , or about $ 4 a share .
35771	The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by $ 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to 7 % from 6.63 % .
35772	First City , which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns , said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere .
35776	British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share buy-out bid .
35777	Derek Stevens , British Air 's chief financial officer , told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of $ 230 a share is `` certainly not too low , '' and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $ 750 million cash investment .
35778	He added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid , and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed .
35784	Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake .
35785	UAL management was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake .
35786	The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .
35790	Mr. Stevens said British Air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group , led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf , and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .
35793	He said the original proposal is dead , and all aspects of a revised version are up for change , in light of the changes in UAL 's market price , the amount of debt banks are willing to fund , and the price British Air would be willing to pay .
35794	Mr. Stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower , but declined to specify a figure .
35796	He added the original offer was `` a pretty full price , '' and that British Air 's contribution `` was quite a large chunk for us . ''
35797	British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company , but was n't particularly happy with paying $ 750 million .
35798	`` If the -LCB- new -RCB- deal had us putting up less money but still having 15 % , that would be a point in our favor , '' he said .
35802	Meanwhile , the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together , in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups , has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself .
35809	Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases , according to a study by the Institute of Medicine .
35811	These programs vary widely , but often require second opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods .
35812	Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans , up from 5 % five years ago .
35815	While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
35817	`` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the panel said .
35818	`` As a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care . ''
35820	Howard Bailit , a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty , said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals .
35822	But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed .
35824	David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs .
35827	Dr. Grossman , who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston , noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .
35828	The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review .
35829	`` Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers , '' the panel concluded .
35830	Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France .
35831	Philippe Gras , a Renault managing director , said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault 's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF 's British plant .
35832	The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s .
35835	Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs -LRB- $ 157.8 million -RRB- in the venture , including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs .
35837	Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .
35838	By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
35839	Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually , and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .
35840	Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks .
35841	Under a separate arrangement , British Aerospace PLC 's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K. , and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France .
35844	The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes , for two reasons .
35846	It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments -- the control of the money supply .
35851	The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness , like high interest rates or slow economic growth , while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence .
35852	This leads to proposals for `` reform '' of the Fed , which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration , to the Congress and to public opinion -- without , however , any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians .
35853	These proposals include changing the term of the chairman , shortening the terms of the members , eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process , putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board , having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress -LRB- the General Accounting Office -RRB- , putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget , and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes .
35855	But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed 's problem is or , if they do , they rest on an incorrect view .
35869	1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output .
35876	Moreover , he is a political agent of a political president , who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election , and less to its longer-run health .
35880	Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates , short-run economic expansion , and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels ?
35883	By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew , in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury , and probably also the Congress , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .
35885	The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical .
35886	The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government .
35887	The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president .
35888	But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed .
35896	Congress would be required to make a hard decision , and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact .
35897	People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives , in addition to stabilizing the price level , which is true .
35899	The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives .
35902	The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth .
35903	But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals , the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation .
35905	Republic New York Corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries , setting out a $ 200 million provision and posting a $ 155.4 million third-quarter net loss as a result .
35907	In the year earlier period , the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of $ 38.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share .
35909	The bank 's medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries total $ 293 million , of which $ 146 million are n't accruing interest , the bank said .
35911	Abortion-rights advocates won last week 's battles , but the war over the nation 's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions .
35912	Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week , with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected shortly thereafter .
35913	Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard .
35914	The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months : the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude , and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere .
35915	The action in Pennsylvania , for example , will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state , and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest .
35916	But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that , along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure , is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement .
35921	`` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . ''
35923	As a result , GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place .
35924	The Freind legislation -- the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother .
35925	Mr. Freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the Supreme Court to review Roe and , perhaps , to overturn it .
35926	But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an `` informed consent '' provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves .
35927	Under this legislation , a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks .
35928	`` Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion , '' Mr. Freind argues , `` it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which , one way or the other , might remain with her for the rest of her life . ''
35932	In Illinois , lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age , weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that , if fetuses survive an abortion , a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive .
35933	The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday , but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall .
35934	Pamela Sutherland , executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council , says she and her allies are `` cautiously optimistic '' they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote .
35935	Abortion foes in Wisconsin , meanwhile , expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March .
35936	In Texas , abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds , personnel and facilities for abortion , and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older .
35939	`` Next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now . ''
35940	This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts , plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey , and girding for next autumn 's state elections .
35942	These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection , and the public funding of alternatives for abortion .
35944	Over the weekend , the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians , including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind , as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques , including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures .
35947	When I was just a child And confronted by my fears , The things that I thought would get me Had fangs and pointed ears .
35948	Nothing much has changed -- My periodic scares Are still from hostile animals , Only now , they 're bulls and bears .
35953	This maker and marketer of cartridge tape systems said it completed the sale of 2.85 million shares of common priced at $ 10 a share in an initial public offering .
35954	The company said that it is selling two million shares and that the rest are being sold by certain stockholders .
35955	Proceeds will be used for capital expenditures and working capital .
35956	Goldman , Sachs & Co. and Montgomery Securities Inc. are co-managing the offering .
35957	Congress sent President Bush an $ 18.4 billion fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service bill providing $ 5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service 's air-interdiction program nearly a third .
35958	Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate , and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch .
35959	An estimated $ 33 million was added for university and science grants , including $ 1.5 million for Smith College .
35960	And Southwest lawmakers were a driving force behind $ 54.6 million for U.S.-Mexico border facilities , or more than double the administration 's request .
35961	More than $ 1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents , and the budget for the official residence of Vice President Quayle is more than doubled , with $ 200,000 designated for improvements to the property .
35962	Even the Office of Management and Budget is remembered with an extra $ 1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb .
35963	Within the IRS , nearly $ 1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns , a 12 % increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago .
35964	Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $ 1.6 billion , and Congress specifically added $ 7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .
35965	The large increase in Customs Service air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling , and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years .
35966	The $ 196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a Lockheed P-3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna Citation II jets .
35970	Repeal is considered likely now , but the Treasury Department bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim .
35973	In a separate development , a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- and Sen. Dale Bumpers -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB- in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $ 44 billion agriculture bill .
35974	A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
35975	The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 .
35976	The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border .
35978	B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan -- including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units -- in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets , company officials said .
35980	If anything , the gyrations in world stock markets -- and in B.A.T 's share price -- since last Friday 's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring , analysts and several big institutional holders said .
35986	To fight off predators , B.A.T plans to spin off about $ 6 billion in assets , largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders .
35987	Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10 % of its shares and a 50 % dividend increase .
35991	Company officials , holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half .
35993	We do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time , '' to take particular steps , said Michael Prideaux , a B.A.T spokesman .
35994	Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring , the company will remain in play , say shareholders and analysts , though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months , rather than six .
35995	The new B.A.T will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business , these holders believe .
35998	`` But I would n't write off '' Sir James or other potential bidders .
35999	Among possible delays , the sales of Saks and Marshall Field -- which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season -- may slide into the second quarter or second half .
36001	B.A.T is n't predicting a postponement because the units `` are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries , '' said Mr. Prideaux .
36003	People familiar with B.A.T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains , and General Cinema Corp. , which is interested in bidding for Saks .
36004	Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T 's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc. , May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc .
36006	Though Sir James has said he intends to mount a new bid for B.A.T once approval from U.S. insurance regulators is received , jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and U.S. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about Sir James 's prospects .
36009	Finally , Tuesday 's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7 % off B.A.T 's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers , which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California .
36012	Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months to come .
36013	But rail , air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday 's earthquake with only minor damage , and many are expected to be operating normally today , government and corporate transport officials said .
36014	Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50 % of normal yesterday afternoon , but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday .
36015	The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation 's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon , until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower .
36016	Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem , however .
36018	Tom Schumacher , executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento , said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday , except for emergency-medical supplies .
36020	`` Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed , but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes .
36021	This -LCB- Wednesday -RCB- morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed , '' Mr. Schumacher said .
36023	A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals , trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake , road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages .
36027	Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage .
36028	Union Pacific Corp. 's rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard , its track , bridges and structures were unharmed .
36030	Southern Pacific Transportation Co. , the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area , said service on its north-south coastline , which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle , was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake .
36041	He added that San Francisco 's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels .
36043	The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International 's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers , three of whom suffered minor injuries .
36044	Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged , but the tower itself was intact .
36045	Tuesday night , thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel .
36046	Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged , but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows , an FAA spokeswoman said .
36047	While the airport was closed , flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton , Calif. ; Reno and Las Vegas , Nev. ; and Los Angeles .
36048	United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
36051	Yesterday , the United ticket counter was active , with people trying to get flights out , but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active , with people trying to get there to help family and friends .
36052	The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday , the Federal Aviation Administration said .
36055	A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco were n't affected , but getting information about its operations was difficult .
36059	Whitbread already has been approached by `` about half a dozen '' companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business , a spokesman said .
36060	Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about # 500 million -LRB- $ 788.8 million -RRB- .
36061	Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin , the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. , and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey .
36062	Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. , which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. , and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley .
36067	Now , it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations .
36073	The Whitbread spirits auction `` is an extremely interesting development ... and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully , '' a Grand Met spokesman said .
36076	Two other global liquor giants , Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC , also are possible buyers .
36077	Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand , but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. .
36082	Smaller liquor companies , such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. , also are likely to be interested .
36086	Whitbread 's wine , spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of # 35.4 million on sales of # 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25 .
36087	The company , which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests , did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell .
36092	British brewers currently own thousands of pubs , which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks .
36096	Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain .
36097	In addition , Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel , liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America .
36098	In Britain , those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country 's Pizza Hut chain .
36099	In Canada and the U.S. , Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants .
36100	Focusing on beer , restaurants and hotels means `` we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively , '' Peter Jarvis , Whitbread 's managing director , said in a statement .
36103	At that time Sam Whitbread , the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder , will retire from executive duties .
36106	The offering will be dated Oct. 31 and mature Oct. 31 ,

36108	NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co. , Valencia , Calif. , announced a 2-for-1 split in the real estate limited partnership 's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33 % , to 40 cents a unit .
36114	Champion International Corp. 's third-quarter profit dropped 17 % , reflecting price declines for certain paper products , operating problems at certain mills , and other factors .
36115	The paper producer reported that net income fell to $ 102.1 million , or $ 1.09 a share , from $ 122.4 million , or $ 1.29 a share , in the year-earlier period .
36127	Digital , based in Maynard , Mass. , hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes , and it has spent almost $ 1 billion developing the new technology .
36132	IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals , including Unisys Corp. , Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. , have struggled recently .
36134	Robert M. Glorioso , Digital 's vice president for high performance systems , says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices .
36141	The computer giant 's current mainframe line , which has sold well and has huge profit margins , is starting to show its age .
36146	IBM is five times the size of Digital -- and 40 times the size of Tandem -- and wields enormous market power .
36148	`` We 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an IBM mainframe , '' concedes Kenneth H. Olsen , Digital 's president .
36149	He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing , which includes retail-sales tracking , airline reservations and bank-teller networks .
36151	A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems .
36153	Stanley Rose , a vice president , technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust , says that despite Digital 's low prices , `` we are n't about to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine .
36156	Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts , juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day , he says .
36165	The first model available will be the 210 , which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger , or vector processor , says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp. , a market research concern .
36169	The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product , and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end .
36173	And National Advanced Systems , a joint venture of Japan 's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp. 's Electronic Data Systems , is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year .

36179	The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off , but the dollar slumped .
36181	Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day , finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon .
36189	`` I think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds .
36196	But prices later reversed course , finishing slightly lower , as investors concluded that any cuts would n't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack .

36207	AMR Corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be `` disappointing '' as well , primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs .
36208	AMR 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records .
36211	The Fort Worth , Texas , company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business , and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days .
36212	Meanwhile , the company 's board , which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump 's recently withdrawn $ 7.5 billion offer for AMR , issued a statement condemning `` ill-conceived and reckless '' bids and saying it was `` pleased '' that Mr. Trump had backed out .
36213	In the third quarter , AMR said , net fell to $ 137 million , or $ 2.16 a share , from $ 150.3 million , or $ 2.50 a share .
36215	AMR 's chairman , Robert L. Crandall , said the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield , an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold .
36216	`` We think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well , '' he said .
36218	Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble , and the whole industry is having a pricing problem . ''
36219	For the nine months , AMR 's net rose 15 % to $ 415.9 million , or $ 6.59 a share , from $ 360.1 million , or $ 5.99 a share .
36221	AMR 's board , in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday , said : `` Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee , financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders ... .
36222	AMR has not been , and is not , for sale . ''
36224	`` Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base , '' he said .

36241	The government said 13.1 % of Americans , or 31.9 million people , were living in poverty in 1988 .
36242	While last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate , the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant .
36244	Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households , William Butz , associate director of the Census Bureau , said that `` most groups either stayed the same or improved . ''
36246	There was no reversal -LCB- of that trend -RCB- between 1987 and 1988 . ''
36249	Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure , including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who are n't living in families .
36252	The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line , but it does n't consider other government benefits , such as Medicare .
36253	Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy , the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3 % , but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years .
36255	In 1988 , 31.6 % of blacks lived in poverty , compared with 10.1 % for whites and 26.8 % for Hispanics .
36259	The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7 % from 20.5 % in 1987 , but remained far higher than a decade ago .
36269	-- Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men , a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978 .
36270	-- Median household income -- which includes both those living in families and those who are n't -- rose 0.3 % last year to $ 27,225 after inflation .
36271	It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West .
36274	-- Among married couples , the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply , as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge .
36277	Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years .
36279	The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget .

36285	Seven years late in the launching , $ 1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors , Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
36288	The $ 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons .
36290	Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of Earth -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape .
36291	Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the `` cosmic paradox '' of life : Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth , but these planets are lifeless ; Earth , on the other hand , has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .
36292	Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life .
36294	In 1979 , two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system .
36295	The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice .
36296	Galileo 's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager 's , according to Torrence Johnson , Galileo 's project scientist , and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth .
36297	Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later .
36300	The five-member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments , including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space , before their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , Monday .
36301	The Galileo project started in 1977 , and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch .
36302	An ebullient Mr. Johnson , wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars , called the launch `` fantastic . ''
36304	`` I 'm happy and sad , '' he said .
36307	Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992 , collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter .
36312	An unmanned spacecraft , Magellan , already is heading to Venus and is due to begin mapping the planet next August .
36313	Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of Neptune and its moon , Triton , this summer .
36315	In December , the shuttle Columbia will try to retrieve a satellite that 's been in orbit for nearly five years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments .
36319	NASA wo n't attempt a rescue ; instead , it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where .
36320	The Associated Press 's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers .
36321	Private relief agencies , such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross , mobilized almost instantly to help people , while the Washington bureaucracy `` took hours getting into gear . ''
36325	Bally Manufacturing Corp. and New York developer Donald Trump have agreed in principle to a $ 6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from Bally 's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. Trump .
36326	According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks , the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden , N.J .
36329	Lawyers for shareholders , Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement , citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed .
36330	But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $ 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump , with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money .
36331	The amount Bally and Mr. Trump will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the $ 45 million Walt Disney Co. and Saul Steinberg 's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July .
36337	Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware , where Bally is incorporated , courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule .
36340	Yesterday , U.S. Judge Alcee Hastings faced his jury -- the full U.S. Senate -- and said , `` I am not guilty of having committed any crime . ''
36343	He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised .
36345	Judge Hastings , who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983 , claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy .
36347	The Senate will deliberate behind closed doors today and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow .
36349	However , Judge Hastings has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court .
36351	In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer , Travelers Cos. , the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country .
36352	Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies .
36356	Avondale asked Travelers to defend it in the state proceeding , but the insurer did n't respond .
36358	The appeals court also said , `` We think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims '' stemming from any cleanup .
36359	`` This decision will have a very considerable impact , '' said Kenneth Abraham , professor of environmental law and insurance law at the University of Virginia , because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in New York .
36360	William Greaney , an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association , said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages , the influence of the appeals court in New York `` will make insurers sit up and listen . ''
36365	The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state , a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field .
36366	`` The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions , '' said Joseph Genova , chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank , Tweed , Hadley & McCloy .
36369	Other areas targeted by the survey 's respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits -LRB- 22 % -RRB- , consumer fraud -LRB- 15.4 % -RRB- , and health-care issues -LRB- 15 % -RRB- .
36376	Mr. Mastro will do civil litigation and white-collar defense work for Gibson Dunn , which is based in Los Angeles .

36381	Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building , Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage .
36382	At the end of the term of the convertible loan , Sears could still own half the building , and AEW could own the other half .
36389	During the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return .
36390	The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal .
36394	But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment , raising property taxes , and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices .
36401	The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between $ 100 million and $ 200 million for Datatronic 's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand-held computer subsidiaries .
36402	In addition , Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers .
36404	The transaction will give Tandy a well-known European computer brand that includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions .
36405	Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals , the company said .
36408	The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s , some tax experts and investment bankers argue .
36410	Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions .
36414	The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n't deductible .
36417	`` It becomes a source of cash '' for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years .
36419	These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc. , Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co .
36420	A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years .
36429	That would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership .
36430	`` The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through , '' said Peter C. Canellos , tax partner at Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz .
36433	The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes , has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five .
36434	The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible .
36437	But those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings .
36438	The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ 17 million the first year and a total of $ 409 million over five years .
36446	The government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake , but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue .
36448	The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing , grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses .
36450	The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless , the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims , and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic .
36451	But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo , and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly .
36452	In Hugo 's wake , Congress allocated $ 1.1 billion in relief funds , and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said $ 273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake .
36454	`` That obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us , and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding , '' Mr. Fitzwater said .
36461	FEMA still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of Hugo , and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that `` we 're pretty thin . ''
36464	`` It 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way , '' said Sally Stewart , a spokeswoman for the Red Cross .
36471	HUD officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound .
36472	Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available , officials said , and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use .
36474	The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation .
36477	One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area , facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers .
36478	Even before the full extent of the devastation was known , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance .
36479	By yesterday afternoon , Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies , physicians , communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California .
36480	A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials to survey the damage .
36481	And the Pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert `` awaiting orders to move emergency supplies . ''
36482	Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento , and Travis Air Force Base , 50 miles northeast of San Francisco , were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers .
36483	Some victims also were treated at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in Oakland .
36484	In addition , 20 military police from the Presidio , a military base in San Francisco , are assisting with traffic control , and a Navy ship was moved from a naval station at Treasure Island near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco to help fight fires .
36485	To help residents in Northern California rebuild , FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies , said Robert Volland , chief of the agency 's individual assistance division .
36486	At these offices , earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses .
36488	The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters .
36491	To get that money , states must go through an elaborate approval process , but officials expect red tape to be cut this time .
36492	Keith Mulrooney , special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson , also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California , the state set tougher standards for bridges , and with federal aid , began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards .
36493	The first phase of the program has been completed , but two other phases are continuing .
36494	The two major structures that failed Tuesday night , he said , were both built well before the 1971 earthquake -- the San Francisco Bay Bridge , completed in the 1930s , and the section of I-880 , built in the 1950s .
36501	As a result , prices paid to farmers for the commodities , which are used in products as diverse as bubble gum and chicken feed , plummet 20 % to 33 % .
36503	Economists expect consumer food prices to jump 5.5 % this year to the highest level since 1980 and up from last year 's 4.1 % rise .
36506	Lower feed prices may help animals eat more cheaply , but humans have to factor in an expensive middleman : the processor .
36512	Costly infertility problems and procedures proliferate as aging baby boomers and others decide to have children -- now .
36513	It 's estimated that one in six couples experiences infertility , and in 1987 , Americans spent about $ 1 billion to fight the problem .
36514	Only about five states now offer some form of insurance coverage , but more are expected .
36517	It adds that births were `` extremely unlikely '' after the fourth cycle and concludes couples who do n't achieve a pregnancy after four to six procedures should be advised that success is unlikely .
36519	`` Such determination may translate into extreme physical , emotional and financial costs , '' the letter warns .

36564	A columnist in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution wrote : `` Who did the research for this report ?

36569	The new edition lists the top 10 metropolitan areas as Anaheim-Santa Ana , Calif. ; Boston ; Louisville , Ky. ; Nassau-Suffolk , N.Y. ; New York ; Pittsburgh ; San Diego ; San Francisco ; Seattle ; and Washington .
36570	Mr. Savageau says earthquake or not , San Francisco makes the list .
36571	But attention also rivets on who finishes last , and Pine Bluff , Ark. -- which finished third to last in 1981 and second to last in 1985 -- is certainly in the running .
36575	Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25 % to $ 21.5 million , or 46 cents a share , while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of $ 76.5 million , or $ 1.83 a share .
36576	Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2 % decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit .
36577	The aerospace concern earned $ 28.8 million , or 61 cents a share , a year earlier .
36580	It earned $ 76.4 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 quarter .
36581	General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments , an earnings recovery in submarine operations , and higher military aircraft sales .
36582	Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp .
36585	Northrop , which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development , said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago .
36590	For the nine months , Northrop reported a net loss of $ 46.9 million , or $ 1 a share , compared with profit of $ 190.3 million , or $ 4.05 a share , in 1988 .
36592	At General Dynamics , factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter , and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter .
36596	For the nine months , General Dynamics earned $ 210.3 million , or $ 5.03 a share , up marginally from $ 208.8 million , or $ 4.97 a share , on a 4.9 % rise in sales to $ 7.41 billion from $ 7.06 billion .
36598	The results topped analysts ' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors , prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years .
36600	Lotus said net rose to $ 23 million , or 54 cents a share , on sales of $ 153.9 million .
36601	A year ago , net was $ 14.3 million , or 31 cents a share , on sales of $ 116.8 million .
36602	For the nine months , net of $ 38.5 million , or 92 cents a share , trailed the year earlier 's $ 49.9 million , or $ 1.08 a share .
36605	Lotus 's results were about 10 % higher than analysts ' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36 % earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond , Wash .
36606	The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins , the result of manufacturing-cost controls .
36609	Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3 's launch , Mr. Sherlund added .
36610	He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter , and held a 70 % or better share of the spreadsheet market .
36612	Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area , a spot check of computer makers turned up little , if any , potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment .
36613	Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods .
36614	Intel Corp. , Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday , though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways ; others elected to take the day off .
36617	Other companies , including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. , completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening 's temblor , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
36618	Personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses , mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors .
36624	Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly .
36625	Digital Equipment Corp. , with major facilities in Santa Clara , Cupertino , Palo Alto and Mountain View , said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard , Mass. , Tuesday night .
36626	None sustained `` significant '' damage , a spokesman said , adding that `` the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally . ''
36629	A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built .
36632	For one thing , buildings there tend to be newer and , thus , in step with the latest safety codes .
36633	Also , the soil in the Valley is solid , unlike the landfill of San Francisco 's downtown Marina District , which was hit with fires and vast destruction .
36636	Intel said that over the past decade , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its plants .
36641	Digital Equipment has set up disaster-recovery response centers in Dallas , Atlanta and Colorado Springs , Colo .
36642	These units were handling calls both from people in the San Francisco area and from computers themselves , which are set to dial Digital automatically when trouble arises .
36646	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where the Energy Department tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons , had only `` superficial damage , '' a spokesman said .
36647	At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale , about 40 miles south of San Francisco , workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that `` there were no show-stoppers '' in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus .
36648	Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling , but `` the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape , '' an official said .
36649	One of Lockheed 's most lucrative sectors -- accounting for more than half the aerospace company 's $ 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile .
36651	Fortunately , the Hubble Space Telescope -- set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October .
36658	His company , Misa Manufacturing Inc. , was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated .
36661	But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight -- it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic -- and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product .
36664	Many larger egg producers are also egg processors , who crack , inspect , and sanitize billions of eggs , turning them into powdered , liquified or frozen egg products .
36665	However , dozens of bakers , restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells .
36667	The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple : put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets , spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets .
36668	One Egg King -- which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 -- can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour .
36673	Chickens carry this bacteria , which can cause upset stomachs and , in rare cases , death among people .
36674	Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs , and it can also be found on unclean shells .
36677	The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and , as an added precaution , to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria .
36684	The Decatur , Ga. , trade group has issued a `` briefing book '' that claims the machine is `` a health hazard '' and that Mr. Maynard is trying `` to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers . ''
36685	The UEP declines to comment , but the group 's attorney , Alfred Frawley , says the group 's actions are motivated solely by `` health concerns . ''
36689	After receiving complaints from egg producers , this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval , thus limiting the machine 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the USDA .
36690	The egg producers also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration .
36693	Mr. Maynard , whose company at the time was based in Santa Ana , Calif. , enlisted his local congressman , and the battle was joined .
36697	So far , New York , New Jersey , Nebraska , Georgia , Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard 's device , citing health concerns .
36698	An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard 's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes .
36699	The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard 's company to pay over $ 100,000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers .
36701	Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower , and started a new company , Adsi Inc. , to market his machine .
36703	Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm .
36704	Michelle Pfeiffer ca n't chew gum and sing at the same time .
36706	As the tough , slinky lounge chanteuse in `` The Fabulous Baker Boys , '' Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself , and more than passably well .
36707	Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do , like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone .
36708	Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music .
36709	When she is n't performing for an audience , she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth , and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in .
36710	Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie , Ms. Pfeiffer 's Susie seems like someone you 've seen before , in numerous show-biz stories -LRB- even her name , Susie Diamond , sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played -RRB- .
36711	Yet nothing about `` Baker Boys , '' and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer , really is like something from the video vault .
36712	Steve Kloves , the young writer and director -LRB- he is n't yet 30 -RRB- , has only one produced picture to his credit ; he wrote the screenplay for `` Racing With the Moon , '' a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s .
36713	Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older , someone who does n't dismiss dreams , but who also has enough experience to see his limits .
36714	However , Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace ; `` Baker Boys '' is both bluesy and funny .
36718	After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder , the late German director , and more recently with Martin Scorsese -LRB- `` After Hours , '' `` The Color of Money , '' `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' -RRB- , Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style .
36720	Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great , too .
36721	What seemed like a good idea , to cast the Bridges brothers -LRB- Jeff and Beau -RRB- as the Baker brothers , actually turned out to be a good idea .
36723	So it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all , that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real .
36724	When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they 've done for 15 years professionally , and twice as long as that for themselves : They 're playing proficient piano , face-to-face , on twin pianos .
36725	They 're small time in the small time-hotels -LRB- not the best ones -RRB- and restaurants in Seattle .
36728	Plump Beau , looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face , plays the older brother , Frank .
36729	Frank plans the program , takes care of business , and approaches the work like any other job .
36731	He 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs ; the audience sees only the house , and only near the end of the movie .
36734	Jeff Bridges is the younger brother , Jack , who fancies himself the rebellious artist ; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs , who climbs down the fire escape .
36735	Yet Jack 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played , and when , and he dutifully shows up for work night after night -LRB- he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute -RRB- .
36736	Looking leaner than he has in a while , the younger Mr. Bridges 's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank , who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated .
36743	And Ms. Pfeiffer 's particular version of `` Making Whoopee '' -- and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her , from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right .
36745	If you 'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen , and you have a lot of patience , take a look at `` Grease 2 . ''
36748	International Proteins Corp. definitively agreed to pay $ 49 million and 2,850,000 of its shares for Hanson PLC 's Ground Round restaurant subsidiary .
36749	Shareholders of International Proteins , a food and agriproducts company , will vote on the transaction at a meeting late next month .
36750	Hanson is a London producer of consumer and other goods .
36754	The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000-square-foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories .
36756	General Dynamics Corp. was awarded contracts totaling $ 589 million for one Navy Trident submarine and for Air Force research on the National Aerospace plane .
36761	Mr. Smith , 50 years old , was formerly responsible for advanced materials , which include plastic composites and alloys , in North America only .
36764	Holders can either convert each share into 421 shares of the company 's common stock , or surrender their shares at the per-share price of $ 1,000 , plus accumulated dividends of $ 6.71 a share .
36765	Galveston-Houston makes and markets products for the construction , mining and energy industries .
36766	Bank Building & Equipment Corp. of America , which previously said accounting discrepancies its auditors uncovered would hurt earnings and require restatement of earlier results , increased its projections of the negative fiscal impact , and said it was exploring the company 's sale .
36767	Bank Building , which builds and equips banks , had announced it would restate the first-three quarters of this fiscal year , which ends Oct. 31 .
36771	Bank Building , which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss , said it engaged advisers to `` explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units . ''
36772	Company auditors are continuing their review , and final restated figures are n't yet available .
36773	Bank Building earlier said the restatement is necessitated by `` certain errors in recording receivables and payables '' at its Loughman Cabinet division .
36776	Gen. Paul X. Kelley , retired commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps , was elected a director of this plastics , specialty materials and aerospace concern , succeeding Jewel Lafontant , who resigned to accept a government position .
36777	Rep. Mary Rose Oakar -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- at last week 's hearings on irregularities in programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development :
36783	On the other hand , if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on , then that 's a whole different story .
36784	But if I feel that there are situations where I 'm trying to get housing for our area -- whatever it happens to be -- and I have to feel that I ca n't even ask a question , I 've got to tell you , I think that 's outrageous . .
36787	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. $ 500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm .
36793	Capcom Futures , while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges , said in a statement that the Merc charges were `` technical in nature '' and that `` no customers were hurt '' as a result of the violations cited by the Merc .
36794	The Merc alleged that , among other things , from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Capcom Futures shareholders .
36796	Formerly president and treasurer , Mr. Lang remains chief executive officer .
36797	Victor C. Benda , 58 , formerly executive vice president , succeeds Mr. Lang as president and becomes chief operating officer , a new post .
36798	Maurice Warren , 56-year-old group managing director , was named chief executive officer of this food and agriculture group .
36806	Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year .
36807	Most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about 8 % or less at major banks , and the yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction fell to 7.61 % for three months and 7.82 % for six months .
36812	Neal Litvack , marketing vice president for Fidelity Investments , said inflows Friday into Fidelity 's Spartan and Cash Reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels , with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds .
36813	Monday and Tuesday `` were lackluster in comparison , '' he said .
36816	Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments -- short-term Treasury securities , commercial paper and the like -- to capture the highest yields .
36817	Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling .
36819	It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year , when rates were marching steadily upward , and hit 42 days in August .
36821	The average 30-day simple yield was 8.26 % , compared with 8.27 % the week before , and the 30-day compound yield slid to 8.60 % from 8.61 % .
36827	whose Della Femina McNamee WCRS agency created liar Joe Isuzu , among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based Eurocom .
36828	The complex restructuring , which was long expected , transforms London-based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of Europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space .
36829	It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by Eurocom and headed jointly by New York ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives .
36831	WCRS 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe , where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk .
36832	For Eurocom , meanwhile , the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in Della Femina , and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide .
36838	The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd. , or EWDB .
36839	The merged agency will include Della Femina McNamee based in New York , Eurocom 's various agencies in France , the Belier Group in Europe and WCRS 's other advertising and direct marketing operations .
36845	He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of # 100 million for acquisitions .
36846	The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in Spain , while Mr. Breene said it also plans to make acquisitions in Scandinavia , Germany and elsewhere .
36848	Della Femina had billings of just $ 660 million last year and ranked as the U.S. 's 24th-largest ad agency .
36850	To make it to top-10 status , it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising , D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom 's DDB Needham .
36853	Since then , Della Femina won Pan Am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients , including Dow Chemical Co. 's Saran Wrap .
36854	But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as Procter & Gamble , Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency .
36856	Still , the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that Europe has seen .
36857	As part of the restructuring , WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across Europe .
36858	What 's more , both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross , who founded Carat , will acquire 14.99 % stakes in WCRS Group , creating a powerful link between Eurocom and Carat .
36862	They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum , which some industry executives pegged at about $ 10 million .
36864	In addition to Carat , WCRS will hold onto its public relations , TV programming and other businesses .
36866	For Carat , meanwhile , the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside France .
36869	They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co. , Fiat S.p . A. , Gillette and Kodak .
36870	But now , other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and Carat wants to expand to the rest of Europe .
36874	Tuesday 's earthquake brought the San Francisco ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday , with only a few staffers showing up at their offices , mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations .
36875	While no agencies reported injuries to employees , the quake damaged the offices of J. Walter Thompson , Chiat\/Day\/Mojo and DDB Needham , among others , spokesmen for those agencies said .
36876	Staffers at Thompson , whose offices are in the ultramodern Embarcadero Center , watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet , according to a spokeswoman .
36877	Plaster fell and windows were broken at Chiat\/Day\/Mojo , a spokesman for that agency said .
36881	A number of agencies , including Thompson and Foote , Cone & Belding , said some employees who live outside of San Francisco , fearful that they would n't be able to get home , spent the night at the agency .
36885	Thompson , a unit of WPP Group , will handle Faberge Organic shampoo and conditioner and Aqua Net hairspray .
36889	He had been president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct .
36901	Diamond-Star Motors Corp. , a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it will begin shipping Mitsubishi Eclipse cars to Japan next week , emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S.-built vehicles back to Japan .
36905	The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years .
36910	There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve .
36912	The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community .
36913	Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful .
36924	Kurds , suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria , Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey .
36926	The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently .
36927	Surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten .
36928	But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end ; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories .
36930	Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months , and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past .
36933	Housing and Urban Development 's budget is $ 17 billion .
36934	From what we and the nation have been reading , the money is n't being spent very well .
36937	But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind .
36940	No doubt many of his ideas are worthy , but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently .
36943	They were appalled , for instance , that he wanted to target more of the $ 3 billion Community Development Block Grant -LRB- CDBG -RRB- program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious `` discretionary '' funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies .
36944	These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages .
36945	They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork , and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar .
36946	Rep. Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
36947	She says it 'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue .
36948	HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money .
36949	At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . ''
36952	We 're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD .
36954	For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities .
36955	In the process HUD has wasted untold billions , created slums and invited corruption .
36956	Much of HUD 's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class .
36957	That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration , which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $ 4 billion in the hole .
36959	Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor , and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units .
36968	It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there .
36971	It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war .
36972	Randy Delchamps was named chairman and chief executive officer of this grocery chain .
36975	Natural upheavals , and most particularly earthquakes , are not only horrible realities in and of themselves , but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed .
36977	The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference .
36980	Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge ?
36981	The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements .
36984	But we are , in reality , witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism : not so much the end of history but the history of the end .
36985	The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them .
36986	Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's okay , necessary even , to look the other way .
36990	That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987 .
36992	In theory , the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same .
36997	His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits , thus restoring the market 's faith in them .
36999	But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way .
37000	The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 .
37001	Result : a landscape littered with lemons , huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America .
37004	Mainstream economists and commentators , craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing , swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs , claimed the end result would be a leaner , meaner corporate America , with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall .
37008	All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities .
37009	Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher , and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow .
37011	In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % , a Harvard study published in April of this year -LRB- and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18 -RRB- found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 % .
37012	What is the consequence of a high-interest burden , high default rates and continued low profitability ?
37014	Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits , they look to the government , which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts .
37019	Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism .
37021	In other words , after the glory boom of the Reagan years , wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16 % as capitalists , helped by the government , turned down the screws or went offshore .
37030	Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks , but there are fault lines -- the crisis in profits , the assault on wages , the structural inequity of the system -- that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over .
37031	Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and LA Weekly .
37032	Japan Air Lines , Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year , a move that could further consolidate the industry .
37033	Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems .
37034	They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen -LRB- $ 140 million -RRB- in the venture , whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany .
37037	Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express , United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies .
37038	Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures , and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines .
37039	In Tokyo , a JAL spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report .
37040	But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture .
37042	In Frankfurt , a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way , but declined to comment .
37045	`` Nothing is defined or signed at this point , '' Mr. Daly said of the talks .
37049	Federal Express and Flying Tiger , as separate companies , carried a combined 2.6 million tons .
37050	Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities .
37051	They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo .
37052	Other airlines would have access to the system , they said , and negotiations with partners were already under way .
37053	Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis , aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck .
37055	Several airlines , including Lufthansa , JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways , are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join , Mr. Daly said .
37057	Last month , the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations .
37059	But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan , a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier .

37064	In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American , New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange .
37066	The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow .
37067	SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market .
37068	Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American , New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE , where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options .
37076	`` I 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options , because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp. , '' said Michael Schwartz , a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co .
37078	While the exchange 's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis , orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles .
37079	Workers could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls .
37084	Charles Daggs , chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co. , said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there .
37086	Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows , despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls .
37088	The traders were executing municipal bond , mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm , Tucker Anthony Inc. , which is also owned by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based in New York .
37090	Volume is down out of San Francisco , but not out of the 11 outlying offices , '' Mr. Daggs added .
37092	Others , like Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , which has eight offices in the San Francisco area , set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help .
37096	At Quotron , the company 's National Call-In Center , which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo , assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders .
37098	Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco , while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out .
37101	The firm also will permit its members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange '' even if the exchange is closed , said Wayne Luthringshausen , chairman of Options Clearing .
37102	-LRB- Put options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to sell a financial instrument at a specified price , while call options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy a financial instrument at a specified price -RRB- .
37103	Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options `` are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument , '' Mr. Luthringshausen said .
37110	The company has spent some $ 5 billion over the past 3 1\/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares , or roughly 7 % of those outstanding .
37112	As of the end of the second quarter , it had $ 4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand .
37114	In Armonk , N.Y. , a spokesman said that although IBM did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock , it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity .
37117	At yesterday 's closing price , $ 1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares , or less than 2 % of the roughly 580 million outstanding .
37119	Over the long term , however , IBM 's stock repurchases -- along with its hefty , $ 4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors -- are providing a floor for the stock price .
37120	Although IBM last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year , it began faltering as early as January .
37122	Then it had a series of smaller glitches , including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations .
37124	None of the problems is necessarily fatal , and they are n't all necessarily even related .
37126	The strong dollar , which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars , is expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off IBM 's per-share earnings for the full year .
37127	Without that problem , IBM might have matched last year 's earnings of $ 5.81 billion , or $ 9.80 a share .
37131	At the opening bell , investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster , including insurers , construction-related companies , refiners and housing lenders .
37132	Brokerage houses jumped in , touting `` post-quake demand '' stocks , and Kidder , Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds .
37134	However , he added , such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information .
37135	The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp. , which rose $ 2.75 to $ 86.50 , Nac Re Corp. , up $ 2 to $ 37.75 , American International Group Inc. , up $ 3.25 to $ 102.625 , and Cigna Corp. , up 87.5 cents to $ 62.50 .
37139	On the prospect for rebuilding northern California , investors bid up cement-makers Calmat Co. , up $ 2.75 to $ 28.75 , and Lone Star Industries Inc. , up $ 1.75 to $ 29.25 .
37140	Bridge and road builders had a field day , including Kasler Corp. , up $ 2.125 to $ 9.875 , Guy F. Atkinson Co. , up 87.5 to $ 61.875 , and Morrison Knudsen Corp. , which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday , up $ 2.25 to $ 44.125 .
37144	Georgia Pacific Corp. , up $ 1.25 to $ 58 , and Maxxam Inc. , up $ 3 to $ 43.75 , both reported strong profits .
37145	Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia-Pacific , Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays .
37147	Tosco Corp. jumped $ 1.125 to $ 20.125 and Chevron Corp. , despite a temporary pipeline shutdown , rose $ 1 to $ 65 .
37148	Meanwhile , shares of some big housing lenders got hit , on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral -- people 's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value .
37149	Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to $ 81.50 , and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to $ 31.875 .
37150	Some California thrift stocks also fell , including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. , which reported lower earnings yesterday .
37155	A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement , and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines .
37156	Heavy construction , property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday .
37157	Friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here .
37158	Petco Options , an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters , is getting out of the trade clearing , or processing and guaranteeing , business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday , options industry officials said .
37161	`` The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business , and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more , '' he said .
37162	He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound .
37166	The CBOE , American Stock Exchange , Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett , owner of Fossett , joined in putting up $ 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options .
37167	The head of another small options clearing firm , who asked not to be identified , said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business .
37170	Mr. Peters , a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders , was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May .
37172	Betty Lombardi is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural Hunterdon County , N.J .
37173	But put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless .
37178	After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies , she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started buying brands free of such oils .
37179	`` I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality , '' Mrs. Lombardi says .
37181	-LRB- Pepperidge Farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost , but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end . -RRB-
37183	She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices , nutritional and environmental concerns , and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty .
37185	Marketers themselves are partly to blame : They 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising .
37190	For the survey , Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers , including Mrs. Lombardi , whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty .
37194	Only 2 % are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories , and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products .
37195	For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes , devotion to a single brand was quite low , with fewer than 30 % saying they usually buy the same brand .
37196	Only for cigarettes , mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60 % of users say they typically stick with the same brand .
37197	People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors , such as cigarettes and ketchup .
37201	Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me , and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale . ''
37202	Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and beer .
37203	People often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys , whether that 's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher 's Uninhibited perfume .
37204	Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries .
37205	Only 23 % of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand , and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand .
37206	Underwear scored a middling 36 % in brand loyalty , but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product .
37207	`` In the past , you just wore Fruit of the Loom and did n't care , '' says Peter Kim , U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency .
37208	`` The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women . ''
37209	He believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty .
37212	Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey ; only 9 % of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance .
37213	Higher-income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days , the Journal survey and other research studies indicate .
37214	Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price .
37219	The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game : How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age .
37220	They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far .
37221	But now that they 're settling down and raising families , might they also show more stability in their brand choices ?
37224	`` Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories , '' he says , `` but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water , but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances . ''
37226	Rather , they tend to have a set of two or three favorites .
37229	If a more absorbent Pampers hits the market , you can be sure a new and improved Huggies wo n't be far behind .
37230	The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied `` brand parity '' and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories , particularly credit cards , paper towels , dry soups and snack chips .
37232	`` Too often , advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer . ''
37234	A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs , magazines and membership clubs for brand users .
37235	While discount promotions are essential for most brands , some companies concede they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons , refunds and other sales incentives .
37241	The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
37242	But since returning to advertising , Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers .
37243	`` Now , Philip Morris -LCB- Kraft General Foods ' parent company -RCB- is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House , '' says Dick Mayer , president of the General Foods USA division .
37244	`` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . ''
37248	Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week , and we 'd like to increase that . ''
37253	Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month .
37255	But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake , coming so soon after the hurricane , will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers .
37257	Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage .
37259	Since commercial air travel is interrupted , Aetna , based in Hartford , Conn. , chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area .
37260	About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks .
37261	Some adjusters , already in other parts of California , drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers .
37263	State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , the largest home and auto insurer in California , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
37265	Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement `` rider '' on a homeowner 's policy in California , because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes .
37268	The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $ 500 million , but only $ 100 million to $ 150 million is insured , it said .
37271	Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage .
37275	That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. , based in Novato , Calif. , and Cigna Corp. , based in Philadelphia .
37284	Among the insurance stocks , big gainers included American International Group , up $ 3.25 to $ 102.625 ; General Re Corp. , up $ 2.75 to $ 86.50 ; Aetna , up $ 2.375 to $ 59.50 ; and Marsh & McLennan Inc. , up $ 3.125 to $ 75.875 .
37288	British , West German , Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster .
37294	Silicon Graphics Inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to $ 5.2 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 1 million , or six cents a share , a year ago .
37298	Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $ 40 million and assumption of related debt .
37302	Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes .
37313	`` I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody , '' the Jaguar chairman asserted yesterday .
37315	The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held , despite Ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how .
37317	He said Jaguar started negotiating with GM and several other car makers over a year ago , but the rest `` dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above # 4 -LRB- $ 6.30 -RRB- a share . ''
37318	Jaguar shares stood at 405 pence before Ford 's initial announcement , but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up .
37321	A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car .
37323	`` We have designs for such -LCB- executive -RCB- cars , but have never been able to develop them , '' Sir John said .
37331	'' Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later , said Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew .
37334	But with its 10.4 % stake , Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely .
37338	`` It has never been done before , but there 's always a first .
37339	Although two Baby Bells showed strong growth in access lines , usage and unregulated business revenue , one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop .
37340	Ameritech Corp. 's earnings increased 2.8 % , after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its Midwest territory .
37341	BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8 % as a result of debt refinancing , the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory .
37343	At BellSouth , based in Atlanta , customer access lines grew by 162,000 , or 3.5 % , during the 12-month period ended Sept .
37346	Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3 % and toll messages jumped 5.2 % .
37347	BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings .
37348	The refinancing of $ 481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by $ 22 million , or five cents a share , but in the long run will save more than $ 250 million in interest costs .
37350	In addition , earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida , Kentucky , Alabama , Tennessee and Louisiana .
37352	At Ameritech , based in Chicago , customer access lines increased by 402,000 , or 2.6 % , and cellular mobile lines increased by 80,000 , or 62.3 % , for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30 .
37355	Local service revenue increased 3.5 % and directory and unregulated business revenue jumped 9.5 % .
37356	But network access revenue dropped 4 % and toll revenue dropped 1.4 % .
37359	c - reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share and extraordinary gain of 14 cents a share from cumulative effect of accounting change .
37360	The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization .
37362	The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 .
37363	The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .
37364	Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data .
37368	Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday , the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge Friday .
37372	Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19 , 1987 , and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while .
37378	In it , traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies .
37383	The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday , or the type of strategies used .
37385	Through August , the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co. , Kidder , Peabody & Co. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc .
37388	On Friday , the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 futures contract -- a `` circuit breaker '' procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time .
37389	Futures trading resumed a half-hour later , but the session ended shortly thereafter , leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs , traders said .
37390	By Monday morning , they said , stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures .
37394	By day 's end , the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points , or nearly half of Friday 's drop .
37397	Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 72.2 million , or $ 3.65 a share , and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings .
37398	The Phoenix-based holding company for Arizona 's largest bank said it added $ 121 million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned .
37399	The company earned $ 18.7 million , or 95 cents a share , a year earlier .
37400	For the nine months , Valley National posted a net loss of $ 136.4 million , or $ 6.90 a share .
37401	It had profit of $ 48.6 million , or $ 2.46 a share , in the 1988 period .
37403	`` The Arizona real estate market continues to be depressed , and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover , '' James P. Simmons , chairman , said .
37404	The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is `` both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders , '' he said .
37405	Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an `` overall assessment of the marketplace '' and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators .
37408	Richard M. Greenwood , Valley National 's executive vice president , said then that the company believed the write-downs were `` adequate '' and did n't plan to increase its reserves again .
37410	The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes , he said .
37411	`` They 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs , but when markets head down , a company is always exposed to further negative surprises , '' Mr. Hoyt said .
37415	Ever since that fearful Black Monday , they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that Oct. 19 , 1987 , was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars .
37419	Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility .
37422	`` I think it will shake confidence one more time , and a lot of this business is based on client confidence . ''
37424	Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987 .
37429	All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big `` retail , '' or individual-investor , businesses .
37438	The retail participation dropped to an average 18.2 % in 1988 , and shriveled to barely 14 % some months during the year .
37439	Yet in 1989 , retail participation has been more than 20 % in every month , and was 23.5 % in August , the latest month for which figures are available .
37444	Joseph Grano , president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market .
37445	Investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says .
37449	`` The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence . ''
37456	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
37471	The two offerings bring Fannie Mae 's 1989 Remic issuance to $ 31 billion and its total volume to $ 43.3 billion since the program began in April 1987 .
37479	$ 200 million of floating-rate notes due November 1994 , paying six-month London interbank offered rate plus 3\/16 point and priced at par via Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd .
37486	Subsequent margins set by agreement between NatWest and Merrill .
37487	If no margin agreed , there is a fallback rate of Libor plus 0.75 point in years one to 15 , and Libor plus 1.25 point thereafter .
37494	Callable on March 31 , 1992 , at 109 , also beginning Sept. 30 , 1992 , from 101 1\/2 and declining half a point semiannually to par .
37501	250 million Dutch guilders of 7 3\/4 % bonds due Nov. 15 , 1999 , priced at 101 1\/4 to yield 7.57 % at issue price and 7.86 % less full fees , via AMRO Bank .
37511	The issue was rated single-B-2 by Moody 's and single-B by S&P .
37514	John V. Holmes , an investment-newsletter publisher , and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies .
37515	As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission , a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms .
37516	Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984 , after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter .
37517	In 1986 , in another consent agreement with the SEC , Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws .
37518	Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes , that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors .
37519	In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte , N.C. , the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc. , Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc. , all of Charlotte , failed repeatedly to file proper documents .
37520	The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures , in violation of his previous consent agreement .
37521	`` Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions , all of which cost money , '' Mr. Holmes said .
37522	Two of Mr. Holmes 's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists , Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum , also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws .
37523	Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer , director or investment adviser of any mutual fund , unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company .
37524	Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith could n't be reached for comment .
37525	In consenting to the injunctions , none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations .
37526	Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations .
37527	At the same time , a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon .
37528	Sen. Bob Packwood -LRB- R. , Ore. -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal , said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along , particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit .
37537	The Packwood plan would also include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
37538	The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses .
37539	Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax .
37540	For their part , the group of Democrats are working on a plan that , like the Packwood proposal , would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies .
37542	An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up .
37545	After then , the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation .
37547	Separately , Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
37549	He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit , including the House-passed capital-gains provision .
37552	Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives , and damage estimated in the billions , most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area were n't greatly affected .
37553	The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two , although some transportation problems may last weeks or months .
37554	A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland .
37556	The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks .
37558	Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .
37561	The battery packs have enough power for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel .
37567	Nevertheless , phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power .
37570	The $ 125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services , according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
37575	A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day , far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system -LRB- BART -RRB- -- which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks .
37576	California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area .
37577	All major roadways except Interstate 880 , known as the Nimitz Freeway , and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday .
37579	The earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack , making them impassible .
37580	Other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines , an emergency relief spokesman says .
37587	Metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a spokeswoman says .
37588	The plant was evacuated and workers sent home .
37589	But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday , and absenteeism was only 7 % of the work force , about twice normal .
37591	Other buildings had broken glass , dangling light fixtures and broken pipes , a spokesperson says , estimating the cost of reconstruction `` in the millions . ''
37592	Most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated .
37594	` When the quake hit , we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up , '' he says .
37595	The Fed serves as a middleman for banks , taking checks from one bank and sending them to another , an operation that it handled smoothly Tuesday night after the quake .
37600	The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes .
37602	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion .
37606	Ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product .
37610	`` There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state , federal and local employment , '' Ms. Mace says .
37611	Adds Stacy Kotman , an economist at Georgia State University , `` There 's nothing positive about an earthquake , but it will probably generate more construction activity . ''
37612	Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies .
37617	There will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would . ''
37619	The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins .
37620	The first effects are , of course , negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending .
37626	`` It 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this , '' says Andrew Goldberg , who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington , D.C .
37629	Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $ 1 billion and could reach $ 4 billion .
37633	Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage , but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums .
37635	The impact on the insurance industry `` will be big and harsh , but less than -LCB- Hurricane -RCB- Hugo , '' says Mr. Byrne , who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake .
37636	Mr. Byrne says Fireman 's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims , but , after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines , the company 's fourthquarter charge against earnings should n't top $ 50 million .
37638	Fireman 's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot .
37639	Fireman 's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area .
37640	In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage , the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service .
37643	A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection , but the great majority are n't covered .
37647	Atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before .
37652	The heart of the earthquake , 6.9 on the Richter scale , was 50 miles to the south , near Santa Cruz , but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway , a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco .
37653	Along the way , the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz , knocked down buildings in San Francisco 's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's Financial District .
37655	Many of the buildings , mostly condominiums and apartments , were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking , rupturing gas lines .
37659	As onlookers stand behind barricades , helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse .
37660	In the Marina District , residents spent yesterday assessing damage , cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors .
37664	`` We always heard about the earthquake , but as children we did n't always listen .
37665	PRINCE HENRI is the crown prince and hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg .
37668	The new bonds will be dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15 , 2019 .
37670	Refcorp , created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August , will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions .
37676	At the state and local level , the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate , inheritance and gift taxes , but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest .
37679	The sheets tell how the medicine works , describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .
37680	They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .
37682	Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients .
37685	According to federal officials and drug-industry studies , nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly , meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
37687	Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
37693	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , which jumped 3\/8 point , or about $ 3.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , during the first hour of trading , ended little changed .
37695	Most junk bonds , which have been battered in recent weeks , continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
37698	Other RJR issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 1\/2 point .
37702	In the multipart offering , the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes .
37709	`` We 're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings , '' said William Sullivan Jr. , director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
37717	But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt .
37723	A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake .
37736	Meanwhile , some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market , but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake .
37739	Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election .
37746	Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims , but no selling materialized .
37747	The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association , two dominant issuers of mortgage securities , have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools .
37749	And because Northern California home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large to be included in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools .
37754	British government bonds , or gilts , ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday 's drop .
37757	Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual `` Mansion House '' address to the financial community .
37768	For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker , who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus , with a man cut of the same cloth : Egon Krenz , the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege .
37771	Still , any change in East Germany has enormous implications , for both East and West .
37772	It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow , Washington and Western Europe .
37775	-LRB- Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media . -RRB-
37776	ADN said Mr. Honecker , a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall , also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military .
37781	In Washington , the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change .
37790	According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
37791	But , with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity , Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle , officials say .
37792	Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag , who has long headed economic affairs , and Joachim Hermann , chief of information policy .
37809	`` He does n't want to have the image of the gun man , '' says Fred Oldenburg , an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne .
37811	As part of his image polishing , Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority .
37812	Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker , Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media , free up travel restrictions , and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups .
37814	West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful .
37816	At the same time , the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow .
37818	Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously . ''
37820	Reports in the West German press , citing sources in East Germany , suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader .
37822	`` This is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step , '' the Bonn official adds .
37825	Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker , Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski , were passed over .
37830	The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't .
37831	From the perspective of East Germany 's old guard , reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being .
37833	Erasing the differences still dividing Europe , and the vast international reordering that implies , wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary .
37834	But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map .
37839	Early in 1987 , Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems .
37840	The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians , in contrast , declared their intentions to reform , while doing nothing concrete about it .
37841	The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries , and giving space to his opponents .
37843	The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road .
37844	Mr. Honecker spoke of `` generally valid objective laws of socialism '' and left no room for debate .
37845	With this year 's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union , and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary , the East German leadership grew still more defensive .
37848	Some loyal voices , in and out of the East German Communist party , saw the nation 's unrest coming .
37860	He was a `` socialist warrior '' who felt rankled by West Germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state .
37861	Finally , during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago , he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought .
37870	Slower growth countries included Greece , at 2.5 % , the U.K. , at 2.25 % , and Denmark , at 1.75 % .
37871	Inflation is expected to be highest in Greece , where it is projected at 14.25 % , and Portugal , at 13 % .
37872	At the other end of the spectrum , West German inflation was forecast at 3 % in 1989 and 2.75 % in 1990 .
37873	Nestle Korea Ltd. opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in Chongju , South Korea .
37874	An official at Nestle Korea , a 50-50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group , said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble , roasted and ground coffee , coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer .
37880	The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered .
37884	Ke Zaishuo , head of China 's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong , accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said , `` This is something we can not accept . ''
37885	The Israeli and Soviet national airlines have reached preliminary agreement for launching the first direct flights between Tel Aviv and Moscow , a spokesman for the Israeli airline , El Al , said .
37886	El Al director Rafi Har-Lev and top officials of the Soviet Union 's Aeroflot negotiated a preliminary pact in Moscow this week , the spokesman said .
37888	The chairman and a director of one of the Republic of Singapore 's leading property companies , City Development Ltd. , or CDL , were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars -LRB- about US$ 409,000 -RRB- .
37889	Kwek Hong Png , chairman of CDL , and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested by the republic 's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night .
37891	Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of S$ 1 million .
37892	The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company 's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL 's controlling Quek family , brokers in Singapore say .
37893	The Queks control the Hong Leong Group , which has widespread interests in manufacturing , property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore .
37894	News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday , but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally .
37898	The paper said the bricks were used to build homes and furnaces and , as a result , the wall `` is in terrible shape .
37900	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
37934	Norton and General Electric Co. last month filed a lawsuit against the former research manager , Chien-Min Sung , charging him with stealing trade secrets .
37937	If convicted , he could be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined $ 250,000 .
37939	He earlier denied the allegations against him in the lawsuit by Norton and GE .
37940	Norton makes sandpaper and other abrasives , diamond tools , specialty plastics and ceramics .
37941	As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments .
37946	There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network , a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc .
37949	`` I was not pleased with the slow start , and neither was NBC News , '' said Guy Hempel , general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville , Ky .
37955	The comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box , but beat everyone else in the stretch . ''
37956	NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday .
37957	The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series .
37958	In place of the games , ABC said it planned to broadcast next week 's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups , except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night .
37961	Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
37965	A company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly appraisal and that circumstances had changed since the December announcement .
37967	Edward J. Tirello Jr. , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , speculated that the sudden dividend elimination presages an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent MeraBank savings and loan unit .
37968	Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between $ 300 million and $ 400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators .
37969	The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company , based in Phoenix , Ariz. , reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate , venture-capital and uranium-mining operations .
37970	Third-quarter net income slid to $ 5.1 million , or six cents a share , from $ 56 million , or 65 cents , a year earlier .
37971	Utility operations , the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period , had a 26 % drop in profit , to $ 86.3 million , largely as a result of outages at the company 's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power .
37981	Under the proposal by Equitec , a financially troubled real-estate syndicator , New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership 's general partner and manager .
37983	Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership , management and financial restructuring of shopping centers , office buildings , apartments and other real estate .
37984	In a statement , Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup .
37989	A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships , which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984 , raised several hundred million dollars from investors .
37993	The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat , which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir , or for his own stake .
37997	Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ 80 a share , Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $ 45 , on average , but yesterday closed at 40 1\/2 , up 1\/4 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
37998	`` It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price , '' Mr. Steinhardt says , though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' `` operating skills . ''
38001	`` If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 , the market was saying Steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything , in terms of getting a deal done , '' says a veteran takeover speculator .
38003	In trying to raid USAir , Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor , and ran into snags .
38005	Mr. Steinhardt , who runs about $ 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners , made his name as a gunslinging trader , moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients .
38008	Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once .
38009	As a result , Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss , or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment .
38023	Since last April , the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir , as he bought and sold the company 's stock .
38024	Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers , and to stir interest in the stock .
38026	USAir and Mr. Buffett wo n't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all .
38030	But meanwhile , USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines , which it acquired .
38031	Moreover , some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months .
38033	While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days , he says that contrary to rumors , he has n't tried to unload his holding .
38035	In 1989 , Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air , AMR and UAL .
38041	The debentures were issued in the face amount of $ 46 million on July 11 , 1988 , the Ashland , Ky. , coal mining , water transportation and construction company said .
38042	The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington 's stock has equaled or exceeded $ 19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days , a condition set in the terms of the debentures .
38045	That will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for Commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering .
38046	Commodore , West Chester , Pa. , had said in August that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter .
38047	Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month .
38049	Still , even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of $ 9.6 million , or 30 cents a share , on sales of $ 200.2 million .
38053	Commodore has assembled an experienced management team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign .
38056	Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas -- mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga , which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware .
38058	The Commodore 64 and 128 , mainly used for children 's educational software and games , had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory .
38059	Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound , but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off .
38062	Activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market 's plunge late Friday and its rebound Monday , as players began to set their sights on events coming later this week .
38065	Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index rose 0.60 to 341.76 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.71 to 320.54 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.43 to 189.32 .
38068	The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7 % of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10 .
38070	Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown .
38071	In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area .
38072	Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
38073	The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
38079	But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent Hurricane Hugo would set the stage for an increase in premium rates .
38081	Marsh & McLennan advanced 3 1\/8 to 75 7\/8 , Alexander & Alexander Services climbed 2 to 32 and Corroon & Black firmed 1 7\/8 to 37 1\/2 .
38082	Elsewhere in the group , General Re rose 2 3\/4 to 86 1\/2 , American International Group gained 3 1\/4 to 102 5\/8 , Aetna Life & Casualty added 2 3\/8 to 59 1\/2 and Cigna advanced 7\/8 to 62 1\/2 .
38084	Companies in the construction , engineering and building-products sectors were among other beneficiaries of earthquake-related buying .
38085	The heavy-construction sector was the session 's best performer among Dow Jones industry groups ; Fluor rose 3\/4 to 33 3\/8 , Morrison Knudsen gained 2 1\/4 to 44 1\/8 , Foster Wheeler added 3\/8 to 18 1\/4 and Ameron climbed 2 3\/8 to 39 3\/4 .
38086	Among engineering firms , CRS Sirrine rose 5\/8 to 34 1\/4 on the Big Board and four others rallied on the American Stock Exchange : Jacobs Engineering Group , which gained 1 1\/8 to 25 3\/8 , Greiner Engineering , which rose 3 1\/2 to 22 1\/2 ; Michael Baker , which added 1 1\/4 to 15 1\/4 , and American Science & Engineering , up 1\/2 to 8 1\/2 .
38087	Within the building-materials group , Georgia-Pacific climbed 1 1\/4 to 58 and Louisiana-Pacific added 1 to 40 3\/4 after Merrill Lynch recommended the forest-products issues .
38088	CalMat advanced 2 3\/4 to 28 3\/4 , Lone Star Industries gained 1 3\/4 to 29 1\/4 , Lafarge rose 1 to 19 1\/2 , Southdown added 5\/8 to 24 5\/8 and Eljer Industries rose 1 1\/4 to 24 7\/8 .
38089	Pacific Gas & Electric fell 3\/8 to 19 5\/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.7 million shares and Pacific Telesis Group slipped 5\/8 to 44 5\/8 as the companies worked to restore service to areas affected by the quake .
38091	The company , based in San Francisco , said it had to shut down a crude-oil pipeline in the Bay area to check for leaks but added that its refinery in nearby Richmond , Calif. , was undamaged .

38210	This temblor-prone city dispatched inspectors , firefighters and other earthquake-trained personnel to aid San Francisco .
38211	But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that do n't .
38215	And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert , ready to send in reinforcements , and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal .

38219	The Arizona Corporations Commission authorized an 11.5 % rate increase at Tucson Electric Power Co. , substantially lower than recommended last month by a commission hearing officer and barely half the rise sought by the utility .
38220	The ruling follows a host of problems at Tucson Electric , including major write-downs , a 60 % slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman Einar Greve during a company investigation of his stock sales .
38222	The company had sought increases totaling $ 80.3 million , or 22 % .

38241	Dale Lang , who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms. and Sassy , is candid about the challenge he is taking on .
38242	Mr. Lang admits that Ms. is `` in dire straits '' and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive .
38243	But the 57-year-old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the magazines ' problems .
38245	Mr. Lang will do away with expensive circulation drives , not to mention sales staff , and attempt to publish the 17-year-old magazine supported by circulation revenue alone .
38249	As for Sassy , which competes directly with News Corp. 's Seventeen magazine , Mr. Lang says that in the next two years he will spend $ 6 million promoting and improving the magazine .
38250	Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988 , it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems .
38252	Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out . ''
38253	He said Sassy will keep its irreverent tone , but added , `` We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine . ''
38254	Sassy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300 .
38258	It gets more mail in a month than McCall 's got in a year , and it 's not from mothers .
38260	Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications .
38262	Two weeks ago , Citicorp and Mr. Lang pumped $ 800,000 into Matilda just to keep the doors open .
38263	Industry observers have congratulated Mr. Lang on what some call his `` courageous '' handling of Ms. , but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews .
38264	Besides Ms. and Sassy , closely held Lang Communications includes Success , a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses , and Working Woman and Working Mother , two monthly magazines .
38265	Working Woman , with circulation near one million , and Working Mother , with 625,000 circulation , are legitimate magazine success stories .
38266	The magazine Success , however , was for years lackluster and unfocused .
38267	Only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved .
38269	Working Woman and Working Mother have operated as part of Working Woman\/McCall 's Group , a less-than-successful joint venture between Mr. Lang and Time Warner Inc .
38270	The joint venture is being undone , with McCall 's magazine being sold last summer to the New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group for about $ 80 million , and Time Warner agreeing to sell back its 50 % interest in Working Woman and Working Mother to Mr. Lang .
38273	Mr. Lang surprised Time soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers , a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers .
38275	Until a recent comeback , it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation .
38276	Time executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality , and in the end , one Time executive who asked not to be identified said , `` Frankly , McCall 's and the joint venture were an embarrassment . ''
38278	`` Their management changed right after -LCB- the venture was formed -RCB- , and I do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines . ''
38284	She will oversee Working Woman , Working Mother and Success magazines , and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman .
38285	The sale price of McCall 's -- twice what Mr. Lang originally paid for it -- will finance Lang Communications ' buy-back of Time Warner 's 50 % interest in Working Woman and Working Mother .
38287	`` We would have to go outside to banks to get the money and I am not ready to do that , '' he said .
38290	Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A. 's purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co. , saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers .
38291	The commission , which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February , said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition .
38292	The French chemical giant would hold an 80 % share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid , methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin .
38294	Morrison Knudsen Corp. posted third-quarter net income of $ 7.9 million , or 69 cents a share , continuing a rebound from steep year-ago losses .
38295	In the third quarter a year-earlier , the construction and engineering concern posted a loss of $ 51.2 million , or $ 4.68 a share .
38298	Morrison said the engineering and construction segment performed well , with the mining and MK-Ferguson operations making important contributions .
38299	Boise , Idaho-based Morrison had losses totaling $ 186 million over the two years ended in December , but it has surged back to profitability as a result of cost-cutting and shedding of unprofitable operations .
38300	In the nine months , the company 's net income was $ 21.5 million , or $ 1.88 a share , compared with a year-earlier loss of $ 97.8 million , or $ 8.96 a share .
38302	The House Ethics Committee officially cited Rep. Jim Bates -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- for sexually harassing two female employees , but did n't recommend formal disciplinary action .
38303	Rep. Bates said he accepted the finding , but one of the victims , Dorena Bertussi , denounced the ethics panel 's action as `` absurd . ''
38305	It ordered Rep. Bates to write letters of apology to Ms. Bertussi and to a second complainant , Karen Dryden .
38310	Rep. Bates has publicly begged for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected with 60 % of the vote last November .
38311	Mesa Airlines said the takeover offer it received earlier this week from StatesWest Airlines is for a combination of cash and securities valued by StatesWest at $ 10 a Mesa share .
38313	When it made the offer , StatesWest declined to disclose details and asked Mesa to do the same .
38314	But Farmington , N.M.-based Mesa said the offer was for $ 7 in cash and unspecified StatesWest securities valued at $ 3 a share .
38321	Profit after taxes and minority interests increased 16 % to # 55.2 million from # 47.6 million in the year-earlier period , while earnings per share rose 16 % to 27.9 pence -LRB- 44 cents -RRB- from 24.1 pence -LRB- 38 cents -RRB- .

38327	Fleet reported nine-month net of $ 279.0 million , or $ 2.51 a primary share , up from $ 248.2 million , or $ 2.28 a share , a year earlier .
38328	Benj . Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $ 8 million , or $ 1.04 a share , as a result of adding $ 11 million in loan-loss reserves .
38329	The Portland , Ore. , thrift , which has $ 5.2 billion of assets , had net income in last year 's third quarter of $ 1.8 million , or 23 cents a share .
38331	The additional reserves relate to possible write-downs of certain assets held by Franklin and its subsidiaries and the default of a bond in its investment portfolio , the thrift said .
38335	It also announced an initial public offering of 18 % of its gas exploration and production subsidiary .
38337	Last year , the company had net income of $ 117.3 million , or $ 1.30 a share .
38339	It said it will take a $ 10 million fourth-quarter charge against discontinued operations , reflecting certain write-downs and the planned sale of a unit .
38341	Arkla Exploration owns sizable gas and crude-oil reserves in the South and Southwest .
38342	South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $ 8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding , said Chris Stals , governor of the Reserve Bank and the country 's chief debt negotiator .
38347	The redemption then would be at 1.5 % of the total debt , increasing to 2.5 % in February 1991 , and to 3 % at six-month intervals thereafter .
38352	Net surged to $ 210.8 million , or $ 2.68 a share , from $ 26.7 million , or 33 cents a share , a year earlier .
38353	The latest quarter included a gain of $ 193.3 million , or $ 2.46 a share , from the sale of New York Times Cable , completed in August .
38354	Exclusive of the gain , operating profit declined 35 % to $ 16.4 million , or 21 cents a share , from $ 25.2 million , or 31 cents a share .
38355	The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall 's , Golf World -LRB- U.S. -RRB- and Sailing World magazines ; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate , and an 8.7 % decline in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship newspaper .
38360	Mr. Taylor 's overwhelming victory against Republican Tom Anderson reclaims a seat the Republicans had held for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special House elections held this year .
38361	Mr. Taylor , a 36-year-old state senator from Bay St. Louis , won 65 % of the vote in a district that has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott .
38362	Mr. Taylor 's victory was an embarrassment for both state and national Republicans .
38363	Mr. Anderson , a former Lott aide , received campaign assistance from the senator and from President Bush , who visited the district last week .

38482	That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that caved in during Tuesday 's temblor .
38486	It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ 250 million , said Charles J. O'Connell , deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation , nicknamed Caltrans .
38489	Caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5-mile stretch of the Harbor Freeway just south of Los Angeles , near the Memorial Coliseum .
38494	`` We 've run out of places to build freeways in L.A. , and the only place to go is up , '' Mr. O'Connell said , although he acknowledges there are many obstacles , including cost .
38495	But as for safety , he says double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale .
38497	But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or `` liquefy , '' in a major quake .
38498	The two-story roadway , designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957 , was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today .
38501	But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below .
38503	Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $ 55 million statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake .
38505	Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took `` reasonable care '' to build and maintain the structures , says John Messina , a Tacoma , Wash. , personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases .
38511	`` Basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure could n't withstand . ''
38513	But only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority , and the Nimitz Freeway , supported by double rows , was left out , Mr. Drago explained .
38515	Charles McCoy in San Francisco and John R. Emshwiller in Los Angeles contributed to this article .
38516	Lionel Corp. 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $ 8 a share , or $ 95.4 million , for as much as 90 % of Lionel by a group with a 9.9 % stake in the toy retailer .
38517	Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to tender their securities , saying it wants to remain independent to pursue its business strategy .
38518	Lionel also said the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate , and full of conditions that leave it `` subject to substantial uncertainty . ''
38519	In addition , Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking to enjoin the offer , alleging , among other things , violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel 's securities .
38522	Efforts by a federal mediator to reignite talks between Boeing Co. and the Machinists union apparently failed , and no further meetings are scheduled .
38523	Company officials and union representatives did n't meet face to face , but the mediator shuttled between the two groups .
38525	Machinists already have rejected a proposal that called for a 4 % pay increase and 8 % bonus in the first year .
38526	In the second year , workers would receive a 3 % wage boost and a 3 % bonus , followed by a 3 % increase without a bonus in the third year .
38528	As the strike enters its 15th day today , some members are getting nervous , the spokesman conceded , but the majority of the 55,000 Machinists are prepared to `` wait it out as long as it takes .
38529	United Merchants & Manufacturers Inc. said its president , Uzi Ruskin , withdrew his proposal to acquire control of the New York textile and clothing company .
38530	Last month , Mr. Ruskin proposed , among other things , to buy 3.5 million shares , or 38 % , for $ 4 apiece .
38531	Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4 % held by an associate , the stake would have given him control of 55 % of the concern .
38532	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Ruskin had said that holders of the other 45 % of United Merchants would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares .
38533	A special committee of United Merchants directors said that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations , it could n't recommend the plan to the full board .
38538	In the aftermath of the California earthquake , President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning .
38539	Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action .
38540	Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast , and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges now .
38542	By noon , Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle , who was in California ; made a televised statement of concern ; signed a disaster proclamation ; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ; and visited FEMA headquarters .
38543	Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism .
38546	He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so .
38547	Beazer PLC , a major British building materials and construction concern , reported a 24 % jump in pretax profit for its latest financial year , helped largely by contributions from its U.S. unit , Koppers Co .
38549	Profit after taxes and minority interests but before extraordinary items increased 22 % to # 92.6 million from # 75.6 million a year earlier , while fully diluted earnings per share rose to 29.90 pence -LRB- 47 cents -RRB- from 24.68 pence -LRB- 39 cents -RRB- .
38553	In 1906 , the rupture was 300 miles long and a couple feet wide .
38554	Though the epicenter of Tuesday 's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz , and 50 miles south of San Francisco , its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion .
38555	But the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill , as were the Marina District of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge -- two areas of maximum devastation .
38556	`` Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it , '' said Douglas Segar , professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University in a televised interview .
38560	You can drive piles on it and build on it . ''
38564	`` We 've known for years and years we 've got lots of old -LCB- pre-1950s -RCB- unreinforced brick and masonry buildings . ''
38565	One old building , the Golden State Bank Building on Front Street , had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake , leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air , while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars .
38569	And sooner or later , we have to do something about it . ''
38570	The urgency is heightened because this week 's earthquake -- while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks -- did n't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon .
38572	`` The Bay Area has three very dangerous faults , the San Andreas , the Hayward fault and the Calaveras fault .
38581	`` The name Classic Coke has tremendous value , and they have n't merchandised that name before , '' says Jesse Meyers , publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest .
38584	Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas , according to Beverage Digest .
38590	As aftershocks shook the San Francisco Bay area , rescuers searched through rubble for survivors of Tuesday 's temblor , and residents picked their way through glass-strewn streets .
38591	In Oakland , hopes faded for finding any more survivors within the concrete and steel from the collapse of an interstate highway .
38592	At least 270 people were reported killed and 1,400 injured in the rush-hour tremor that caused billions of dollars of damage along 100 miles of the San Andreas fault .
38593	Bush declared the region a major disaster area and the military was mobilized to prevent looting .
38594	The baseball commissioner said the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics would be played Tuesday in Candlestick Park .
38599	Honecker 's departure came after weeks of street protests and an exodus to the West of East Germans who had become disenchanted with his rule .
38601	At a nationally televised legislative session in Budapest , the Parliament overwhelmingly approved changes formally ending one-party domination in the country , regulating free elections by next summer and establishing the office of state president to replace a 21-member council .
38604	The voting for new laws followed dissolution of Hungary 's Communist Party this month and its replacement by a Western-style Socialist Party .
38605	The space shuttle Atlantis blasted into orbit from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , and its crew of five astronauts launched the nuclear-powered Galileo space probe on a flight to the planet Jupiter .
38608	South Korea 's President Roh addressed a joint House-Senate meeting and urged patience over U.S. demands for the opening of Seoul 's markets to more American goods , saying trade issues would be `` resolved to mutual satisfaction . ''
38610	The Census Bureau reported that 13.1 % of the U.S. population , or 31.9 million people , were living in poverty in 1988 .
38611	Last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate .
38612	Per capita income rose 1.7 % to $ 13,120 , but median family income fell 0.2 % .
38613	The Bush administration accused Israeli Prime Minister Shamir of hindering peace efforts in the Mideast with `` unhelpful '' and disappointing statements .
38619	But other nations at the opening of the 49-nation meeting of Britain and its former colonies pressed for continued or stronger embargoes in an effort to end apartheid .
38624	Most of the country 's 20,000 judges and judicial employees joined the work stoppage .
38628	Figgie is a fire protection , electronics and industrial products concern .
38631	Dow 's third-quarter net fell to $ 589 million , or $ 3.29 a share , from $ 632 million , or $ 3.36 a share , a year ago .
38634	A spokeswoman said Dow is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $ 14.60 a share , compared with last year 's record net of $ 2.4 billion , or $ 12.76 a share .
38635	But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $ 3.44 a share , or $ 635 million .
38640	Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors , including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals , a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar , which made Dow 's exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers .
38642	For the first nine months of the year , Dow earned $ 2.06 billion , or $ 11.41 a share , up 17 % from $ 1.76 billion , or $ 9.32 a share , a year ago .
38644	Whether or not `` great cases make bad-law '' -- as Justice Holmes asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history ?
38645	Ethan Bronner 's `` Battle for Justice : How the Bork Nomination Shook America '' -LRB- Norton , 399 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings , done with journalistic verve , but with a flawed legal philosophy .
38647	What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power , in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized .
38648	In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic , with piquant character portrayal , hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history .
38651	Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments , the contingency plans in place , and Mr. Bork 's paper trail of vulnerable writings , it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed .
38655	Harvard 's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy , laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow .
38660	It achieved a good media play , and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of `` conscience . ''
38663	The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines .
38664	But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections .
38665	Demographics converged with `` mainstream '' and demonizing to seal Robert Bork 's fate .
38667	Mr. Bork 's opponents chose the battlefield , held it and kept it .
38668	Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy , an `` 80 percenter '' only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork , the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war .
38670	The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey , with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen .
38676	His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine , which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives .
38677	Unfortunately , Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere .
38680	A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters -LRB- decided in the Griswold case -RRB- to abortion as well .
38681	One can understand Mr. Bork 's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched , though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism , guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it .
38683	Mr. Lerner is a writer and historian living in New York .
38686	The collection , which includes two early Picassos , a van Gogh , a Monet , other paintings , furniture and porcelains , went on sale last night in the first of six auctions .
38688	A corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding buyers .
38693	Instead , people familiar with the transaction said , the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $ 100 million .
38702	When Christie 's officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the Dorrance collection , representatives of the Dorrance family `` told us it was a question of financial considerations , '' said Michael Findlay , Christie 's head of impressionist and modern paintings .
38703	Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom , but recently it appears Sotheby 's has been returning the compliment .
38706	But two weeks ago , Sotheby 's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid .
38707	Sotheby 's is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market , at least where the best works are concerned , says Ralph Lerner , an attorney and author of the book `` Art Law . ''
38708	`` There seems to be a lot of art for sale , but there 's more competition .
38716	The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many , since Mr. Dorrance had served as chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution .
38724	Dealers and auction houses `` know if they do n't lay out a half a million for this , another one will ; it 's that competitive . ''
38725	In January , two small New York galleries , the Coe Kerr Gallery and Beadleston Fine Arts , snatched a major art collection owned by the Askin family away from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $ 25 million .
38726	A Christie 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller 's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- Christie 's wo n't offer financial guarantees because `` Christie 's believes its primary role is as an auction house , and therefore as an agent -LCB- for buyer and seller -RCB- , not as a bank .
38730	Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman , however , he would still stand a good chance of losing a country .
38733	More recently , Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security , and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo .
38736	Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall .
38737	In this scenario it 's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic , federal or stronger -- with West Germany .
38740	The West German embassies in Prague , Budapest and Warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates .
38742	Two of the last gestures of the Honecker regime were to close the border to Czechoslovakia and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier .
38745	But even if he effects a Hyde-to-Jekyll transformation , he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two .
38746	The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states , such as North Korea , but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc .
38747	When Poland moves to reform , it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski 's interwar republic , it was a nonsocialist democracy .
38752	Up to now , the main weapon of the `` worker and peasant state '' has been the ideology of socialism .
38754	Without Moscow 's military and party behind it , East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating .
38755	If it goes capitalist , and increases trade with West Germany , it will convert itself , willy-nilly , into an economic annex of the Federal Republic .
38756	There 's a certain cruel logic at work here : It 's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced Karl Marx should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls .
38758	Ideologues are the last to surrender , and Germans are an ideological people .
38762	But within the government and in the think tanks outside it , many West Germans maintain that they do n't want immediate reunification .
38764	But it would be ironic if Germany 's reunification , just like its division , eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin .
38772	Computer and software companies in the region are expecting virtually no long-term disruption in shipments .
38773	Also , investors quickly singled out stocks of companies expected to profit or suffer from the disaster .
38775	The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom .
38784	British Airways said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Air 's parent .
38790	B.A.T Industries may delay part of its defensive restructuring plan , including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units .
38809	News of the major earthquake in California Tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early Asian trade , but most foreign-exchange dealers said they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short-lived .
38811	Harris Trust 's Mr. Woodland noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of `` headline negatives '' in recent weeks , including rate increases in Europe and Japan , aggressive central bank intervention , a 190-point plunge in New York stock prices , an unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report and action by the Federal Reserve to nudge U.S. rates lower .
38812	While Mr. Woodland does n't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world , he noted that `` its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- `` impressively '' limited .
38813	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8485 marks , down from 1.8667 marks late Tuesday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 142.75 yen late Tuesday .
38816	Since Friday 's dive in stock market prices , the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987 's stock market debacle .
38817	Some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and Tuesday 's California earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate .
38821	For now , traders say the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street .
38832	Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed .
38840	But yesterday , as the morning wore on , some major West Coast refinery operators -- including Chevron Corp. , Exxon Corp. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group -- said their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally .
38841	Most said they shut down their petroleum pipeline operations as a precaution but did n't see any immediate damage .
38849	But once that factor was eliminated , traders took profits and focused on crude oil inventories , Mr. Barakat said .
38852	`` The problem is that while on the surface everything is all right , the question is , '' said Mr. Barakat , `` was there any structural damage to the pipelines or anything else . ''
38864	The first analyst said that the Japanese , as well as the Chinese , bought copper earlier in the week in London , but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation , at least over the long term , appears to have improved .
38865	`` The focus for some time has been on the copper supply , and good demand has been taken for granted , '' he said .
38877	That country recently bought 200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but did n't .
38878	`` It 's known they need the sugar , and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support , '' the dealer said .

38891	But researchers say the drug , called FK-506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates .
38893	Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
38900	They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506 , compared with cyclosporine , which can cause renal failure , morbidity , nausea and other problems .
38902	Dr. Fung said that FK-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year , and that the FDA approval process usually takes three years to five years .
38904	Researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50 % and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients .
38905	Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds , and that Fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants .
38907	`` We 've known for six months the effect of this drug , and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock , '' Dr. Starzl said , adding that profiting from FK-506 would n't be ethical .
38911	Yet in Mr. Laband 's rehash of free-market logic , human greed and self-interest are the only permissible psychological reactions .
38914	Rather , lines would diminish because at higher prices many victims could not afford necessities such as food and medical supplies .
38916	Moreover , essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease .
38917	Such spillover effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources .
38918	Fortunately , volunteers and charities are not motivated by self-interest , but by altruism .
38921	The government is actually protecting avaricious ice-baggers and other profiteers who can not see beyond their own short-term gain .
38922	South Carolina deserves an A for its quick and timely relief efforts .
38930	They set up absurd situations , detached from reality , and then try to reason from them .
38931	I 'm surprised he did n't advocate letting people loot , since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and `` every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor . ''
38937	They divert law-enforcement resources at a time they are most needed for protecting lives and property .
38938	Also , rather than increase supplies , they reduce them and encourage hoarding .
38939	And they , or even the prospect of them , discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by merchants .
38942	Would Mr. Laband also suggest that the Red Cross , Salvation Army , military units , police , fire departments , rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to assist Hugo 's victims because they interfere with his concept of the `` free market '' ?
38943	What about those caring people all over the country who are donating food , water and other necessities of life to these people who could be any of us ?
38947	Should they be required to pay claims based on exorbitant costs for labor and materials ?
38952	Having been through several tornadoes and hurricanes , I have a different perspective .
38953	Mine comes from seeing thriving communities devastated -- but only temporarily .
38954	Their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of neighbors .
38955	The shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat .
38959	We here in the affected areas were dazzled by Mr. Laband 's analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development .
38960	His theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him .
38971	Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes , the Goodman and Steppenwolf .
38972	Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship , but both help explain why Chicago remains a vital center of this country 's regional theater movement .
38974	The original is a comedy about Alceste , a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself .
38975	He is the jealous friend of Philinte , and the jealous lover of Celimene .
38976	The play is filled with intrigue , dishonesty and injustice .
38979	Assuming modern audiences readily understand that Moliere 's social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century Paris , Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter .
38980	The Wilbur translation is remarkable -- well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity .
38982	If Mr. Wilbur 's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century Paris , Mr. Falls 's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves .
38983	Mr. Falls , the Goodman 's artistic director , took a recent adaptation by Neil Bartlett and significantly adapted it .
38984	Mr. Bartlett had slimmed Moliere 's cast of characters to six and set them in the London media world of Thatcherite Britain .
38985	Mr. Falls transfers the setting to Hollywood , and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there -- agents , producers , actors , writers and sycophants .
38988	Mr. Falls kept the form , but Americanized it with Mr. Bartlett 's further help .
38989	With a splendid cast led by David Darlow as Alceste , Christina Haag as Celimene and , especially , William Brown as a Philinte who plays the Hollywood game but harbors authentic values and feelings , the Goodman production barrels through an all-night Hollywood party with exuberance and wit .
38990	If this version , with its references to Steven Spielberg , Spago and `` thirtysomething '' attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version , then Messrs. Bartlett and Falls are justified in abandoning Mr. Wilbur .
38992	The Steppenwolf Theatre Company , back from a critical and box office success in London with its adaptation of Steinbeck 's `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' opened the new season with Harold Pinter 's `` The Homecoming , '' first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1965 .
38993	Back then , Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright , but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares , almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue .
38994	When `` The Homecoming '' was first produced on this side of the Atlantic , actors and directors were reverential .
38995	Silences were lengthy -- nobody moved or gestured .
38996	Nobody smiled onstage , and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh .
38998	Also , it was not a funny time over here , what with the Vietnam War , the '68 Democratic convention , assassinations and riots .
38999	But under Jerry Perry 's direction the current Steppenwolf production , scheduled to play through Nov. 19 , breaks through the flat and boring ritual that `` The Homecoming '' had become .
39000	Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max , the father , the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family 's rage , bitterness , fear and isolation .
39001	Encouraged by Mr. Wilder 's sly grins , embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages , the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act .
39002	Three of the family members , Max and his two sons , Lenny and Joey , live off the flesh : Max is a retired butcher , Lenny a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer .
39003	Sam , Max 's brother , has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife .
39008	As Ruth , Moira Harris , a large and beautiful woman who may be our next Colleen Dewhurst , begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men .
39010	We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother , and then some .
39011	While Steppenwolf was in London with `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' Bruce Sagan , the president of its board of directors , quietly returned to Chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city 's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district .
39013	The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production .
39018	Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois -LRB- the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater -RRB- , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets .
39020	His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
39023	What will Mr. Sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich -LRB- `` Dangerous Liaisons '' -RRB- , Joan Allen -LRB- `` The Heidi Chronicles '' -RRB- , and Glenne Headly -LRB- `` Lonesome Dove '' -RRB- , and the company crumbles ?
39026	Mr. Henning is a Chicago-based law firm management consultant and a writer .
39028	The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.7 % , or 3.35 , to 463.28 .
39030	Among bigger stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1 % , or 4.56 , to 453.05 , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 % .
39034	`` We 're just recovering and getting back to business as usual .
39036	The trading pace was busy , with 4,343 issues and 147.6 million shares changing hands .
39038	Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern California .
39039	As investors speculated about the long - and short-term implications , shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded .
39040	Heading the list : insurance , construction and technology companies located in the San Francisco Bay Area .
39041	Insurance-related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns .
39042	Traders said property-casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the San Francisco area include the OTC 's Safeco and Ohio Casualty .
39044	Then , if the stocks fell sharply , he planned to begin buying them aggressively , on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month 's Hurricane Hugo .
39045	As well , reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits .
39049	`` Now , they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases . ''
39054	Academy Insurance fell 1\/32 to 1 3\/16 ; but volume totaled 1.2 million shares .
39055	The Nasdaq Insurance Index jumped 4.15 to 529.32 on the day , while the barometer of big insurance and banking issues climbed 1.72 to 455.29 .
39058	Shares of Kasler , a California road and bridge builder , were heavily traded , jumping 2 1\/8 to 9 7\/8 on 1.3 million shares .
39060	The company , based in San Francisco , provides industrial infrastructure engineering and construction services .
39067	Chiron was up 1\/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1\/2 to 16 3\/8 .
39069	Microsoft advanced 1 7\/8 to 80 1\/2 and Lotus Development added 1 1\/4 to 32 1\/2 .
39070	In other earthquake-related news , Hambrecht & Quist 's OTC market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen for the day by the National Association of Securities Dealers .
39072	In New York , Roger Killion , a Hambrecht executive vice president , said he expects OTC trading at the company to resume this morning , either in New York or in San Francisco .
39080	Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. said they extended their offer for Connaught BioSciences Inc. , valued at 866 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 736 million -RRB- to Oct. 27 .
39081	The companies earlier said they did n't want to raise their offer to match a rival bid by Institut Merieux S.A. of C$ 37 a share , or C$ 942 million .
39082	But they said the C$ 30-a-share bid , which was due to expire Monday , may still be extended or varied .
39086	Connaught is a biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concern .
39089	Within minutes after the stock market closed Friday , I called Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey , advised him that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 190 points late that afternoon , and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow Democrats were to blame .
39094	He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds .
39095	The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the Oct. 15 deadline , and these Senate Democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to append capital gains to the budget bill , knowing it would pass .
39097	It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month , or it could follow the White House strategy , to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended .
39102	Mr. Rahn was shocked , telephoning the office of Richard Darman , director of the Office of Management and Budget , and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue .
39115	When Richard Rahn advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains , he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed .
39116	Instead , the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7 % off the value of the nation 's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world .
39120	They are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich .
39121	Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close Friday morning and is now problematic .
39122	The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances from Mr. Darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut , which is alive and well .
39125	That is , with capital gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates .
39126	The counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy .
39128	If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains , though , it would pass , Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market , the 1990 economy would be robust , and the revenue gains at every level of government , including New Jersey 's , would be surprisingly high .
39131	In Washington and on Wall Street .
39134	William Craig , an independent record promoter , pleaded guilty to payola and criminal tax charges , according to a statement issued by Gary Feess , the U.S. attorney here .
39138	Mr. Craig and three others were indicted last year as part of that payola probe .
39139	Two other defendants previously pleaded guilty , and charges against the third were dropped .
39141	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
39142	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
39159	The Treasury contended that TVA could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market .
39160	The $ 4 billion in bonds break down as follows : $ 1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25 % and a yield to maturity of 8.33 % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375 % and a yield to maturity of 8.42 % ; $ 2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection , a coupon rate of 8.75 % and a yield to maturity of 9.06 % .
39161	Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by First Boston Corp. and co-managed by Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , Morgan Stanley & Co. , and Salomon Brothers Inc .
39163	Mr. Templeton owns shares in several of the 33 funds that his firm manages , but only in three of the 10 available to U.S. investors , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
39164	Those are Templeton Global Income , Templeton Emerging Markets and now the Value Fund .
39167	`` Emerging growth stocks have n't been popular in America for years , they 've been neglected , '' he said , and their prices often trail the market as a whole .
39168	Mr. Templeton 's 147,300-share purchase in the closed-end fund came before the U.S. stock market 's plunge last Friday , but still proved slightly profitable .
39169	Mr. Templeton bought his shares in several separate purchases between Aug. 30 and Sept. 28 , according to reports with the SEC .
39174	A senior vice president and a vice president at James River Corp. sold the majority of their shares in the Richmond , Va. , paper-products concern in late August and early September , reports filed with the SEC show .
39177	On Sept. 6 , Robert Joseph Sherry , the firm 's senior vice president of employee and public relations , sold 4,000 shares , leaving himself with 1,062 shares of James River .
39189	`` Cincinnati Gas & Electric is in good shape , '' Mr. Taft said , and utilities are `` a good investment because interest rates are going down . ''
39192	The two other directors bought 1,000 and 1,900 shares , respectively , at prices between $ 28.15 a share and $ 28.75 a share , filings with the SEC show .
39195	`` I do n't know of any news or anything unusual happening here , '' said Bruce Stoecklin , director of media services .
39197	T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. said directors recommended stockholders approve a 2-for-1 stock split and an increase in authorized shares to 25 million from 10 million .
39199	T. Rowe Price is an investment adviser to mutual funds , institutions and individuals .
39202	Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati had sued the com - pany in 1981 after installing Burlington carpets in their office .
39204	As a result of their illness , the Beebes said , they lost $ 1.8 million in wages and earnings .
39207	Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside .
39209	He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later .
39211	Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said .
39217	Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of New York , which are co-sponsoring the project , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines .
39223	As part of the agreement with the state , the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending .
39226	The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district .
39227	State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel .
39231	However , Judge Weinstein wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined as political acts .
39239	Mr. Gotlieb , who serves as a consultant to Stikeman , Elliott , one of Canada 's biggest law firms , is advising Pepper Hamilton 's Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian-U.S. investment , corporate finance and international transactions .
39243	In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .
39249	On Oct. 22 , led by Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest exporter , they embargoed oil shipments to the U.S. and to the Netherlands , Israel 's staunchest European ally .
39252	In 1956 , when Britain , France and Israel invaded Egypt to seize the Suez Canal , Arab producers cut off supplies to Europe .
39254	U.S. oil supplies , however , had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining .
39255	Imports , then six million barrels a day , came primarily from Venezuela and Canada .
39258	Politics and economics conspired .
39259	Japan and Europe , far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S. , would n't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies .
39261	But car-happy Americans panicked , and so did the U.S. and other oil-consuming governments .
39262	`` Shortage '' and `` crisis '' became buzz words , although neither really applied .
39264	The embargo lasted only six months , but the price hikes became a fact of life .
39266	Once and for all , $ 5-a-barrel crude oil and 35-cents-a-gallon gasoline were history .
39267	Times may be tough on Wall Street for some , but a few bosses are making as much as ever -- or more .
39271	The increase is noted in the brokerage firm 's latest proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
39274	Meanwhile , Bear Stearns 's 650 stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year , which the company says reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets .
39277	`` All of us are on a base salary of $ 200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that 's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes , '' Mr. Montgoris said .
39280	According to the proxy statement , James E. Cayne , 55 , Bear Stearns 's president , made $ 3.9 million ; an executive vice president , Michael L. Tarnopol , 53 , made nearly $ 3.4 million ; and two executive vice presidents , Vincent J. Mattone , 44 , and William J. Michaelcheck , 42 , made about $ 3.3 million each .
39285	Mr. Craven is widely credited with refocusing Morgan Grenfell 's energies on its core corporate finance , fund management and banking activities over the past year .
39287	Mr. Craven said his move to the chairmanship means he will take a less active role in the day-to-day management of the group , but he added that the merchant bank 's strategic focus remains unchanged .
39288	Mr. Craven joined Morgan Grenfell as group chief executive in May 1987 , a few months after the resignations of former Chief Executive Christopher Reeves and other top officials because of the merchant bank 's role in Guinness PLC 's controversial takeover of Distiller 's Co. in 1986 .
39294	Mr. Craven said both Messrs. Eward and Whittington had planned to leave the bank earlier , but Mr. Craven had persuaded them to remain until the bank was in a healthy position .
39295	`` If there 's any coincidence about the departures it 's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well . ''
39296	Last month , Morgan Grenfell announced its pretax profit rose 49.6 % to # 32.8 million in the first half , boosted by a healthy growth in its domestic and international corporate finance business .
39297	The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
39300	Rated single-A-3 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Goldman , Sachs & Co .

39308	The bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P .
39310	The zero-coupon bonds were priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 .
39311	The bonds have received a rating of double-A-1 from Moody 's , and a double-A-plus rating is expected from S&P , the underwriter said .
39312	Oregon -- $ 100 million of general obligation veterans ' tax notes , Series 1989 , dated Nov. 1 , 1989 , and due Nov. 1 , 1990 , through a Chemical Securities Inc. group .
39314	The notes are rated MIG-1 by Moody 's and SP1-plus by S&P .
39315	University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey -- $ 55.8 million of Series C bonds priced by a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group .
39316	The bonds , rated single-A by Moody 's and double-A by S&P , were priced to yield from 6.20 % in 1992 to 7.26 % in 2019 .
39322	The offering , Series 1989-82 , is backed by Fannie Mae 9 1\/2 % securities and used at-market pricing .
39323	The issue brings Fannie Mae 's 1989 Remic issuance to $ 30.2 billion and its total volume to $ 42.3 billion since the program began in April 1987 .
39328	Sammi Steel Co . -LRB- Korea -RRB- -- $ 50 million of bonds due Nov. 8 , 1994 , with equity-purchase warrants , indicating a 1 1\/4 % to 1 3\/4 % coupon at par , via Merrill Lynch International Ltd. and Dong Suh Securities Co .
39341	The issue is rated triple-A by Moody 's and triple-A by S&P .
39342	Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said it named its interim president and chief executive officer , Kenneth I. Sawyer , to those posts permanently , and elected him to the board .
39343	Par also said it was advised by the U.S. attorney for Maryland that it is one of a number of companies being investigated by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act .
39344	Par , a generic-drug maker that has been plagued by management problems , was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the drug-approval process and a Food and Drug Administration investigation .
39346	At the time , the company said it was recalling one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others .
39350	Also yesterday , Ashok Patel , a former Par official who pleaded guilty to providing an FDA employee an illegal gratuity of $ 3,000 , was sentenced by a federal judge in Baltimore to one year of community service and a $ 150,000 fine .
39353	In July , Par and a 60%-owned unit agreed to plead guilty in that inquiry , as did another former Par official .
39355	Par said it selected him for the posts of president and chief executive on a permanent basis because of his experience in the industry and his performance at Par .
39356	Perry Levine , chairman , said Mr. Sawyer had `` taken significant steps '' to restore the company 's credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity .
39358	What do you say we all close down the poker game , go home and bank the $ 16 billion ?
39359	That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get .
39366	Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted .
39381	Others were the capital-gains cut , Section 89 repeal , the disabled workers bill , and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act .
39382	All this stuff still is in the House 's 1,878-page reconciliation bill , and many Members say they 're reluctant to pull out cherished bills , just to see them die .
39386	We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy , breezy days in Washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build , roads paved , soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for .
39388	Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative .
39389	Save the sequester , and let Washington scream .
39391	Seats are currently quoted at $ 425,000 bid and $ 475,000 offered .
39396	Proceeds of the sale will be used to redeem C$ 675 million of government bonds maturing Nov. 1 and for general government purposes .

39401	Noting the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of Interferon 's genital warts treatment , National Patent said it believes Interferon 's stock is undervalued .
39405	Paris shares had a similar reaction , but most other European bourses posted gains , as did all major Asian and Pacific stock markets .
39407	The rise came a day after the year 's biggest drop on Monday , when the Nikkei fell 647.33 , or 1.8 % , in response to Friday 's 6.9 % plunge on Wall Street .
39409	On Tuesday , the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index of issues listed in the first section , which fell 45.66 Monday , rose 41.76 , or 1.61 % , to 2642.64 .
39413	Japanese domestic institutions , including trust banks and investment management firms , that had been on the sidelines during Monday 's fall were back in the market , analysts said .
39414	Foreign investors reportedly started off selling but later joined in the buying .
39415	The Tokyo rally seemed to confirm the view , frequently expressed in Japan in the past few days , that the drop in New York was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. .
39418	But even though Tokyo appears unharmed by recent market volatility , analysts and traders say there are still a few concerns on the horizon .
39423	Yesterday 's buyers favored real estate , construction and other large-capitalization issues , reflecting the fact that many Tokyo investors now feel safer with domestically oriented stocks , analysts said .
39424	They also are concerned about the persistent strength of the dollar against the yen , as a weaker yen leads to higher import prices in Japan and adds to domestic inflationary pressures .
39425	Currency concerns also weigh heavily on interest rate-sensitive stocks such as banking and other financial issues because of fears that Japanese interest rates might have to rise to keep the dollar in check .
39426	Among steel shares , NKK rose 19 to 705 yen -LRB- $ 4.97 -RRB- a share , and Nippon Steel gained 17 to 735 .
39428	In the real estate sector , Mitsui Real Estate Development was up 100 at 2,760 , and Mitsubishi Estate gained 80 to 2,360 .
39432	Volume was an active 643.3 million shares , about double the recent levels but down from 959.3 million the previous day , which U.K. traders have dubbed `` Manic Monday . ''
39433	Prices opened strongly on the basis of Monday 's Wall Street rally and yesterday 's gains in Tokyo .
39434	But the advance faltered as index-options traders and investors jittery about the U.K. economic outlook took over .
39436	Michael Hicks , who manages sales and trading for brokerage concern Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull , said : `` It 's a nervous market .
39438	If you bought , you wish you had n't , and if you sold , you wish you had n't . ''
39439	He said the current market `` is all about sentiment , and the sentiment in London is 90 % anxiety and worry . ''
39441	Dealers said London showed signs of calming in midafternoon after Wall Street avoided sharp losses despite the trade report , but a wave of futures-related selling later in the session sent buyers back to the sidelines .
39446	Hambros rose 5 to 204 , and Schroders rose 25 to # 12.75 .
39449	Amstrad , a British computer hardware and communications equipment maker , eased 4 to 47 .

39452	Bass ended up 3 higher at 966 , Guinness closed at 589 , down 7 , and Scottish & Newcastle dropped 11 to 359 , but Whitbread Class A shares rose 17 to 363 .
39454	The most active shares were major blue-chips , particularly oils and utilities such as British Gas and British Telecommunications .
39456	British Gas finished at 197 , down 2 , on 13 million shares , British Petroleum fell 8 to 291 on 9.4 million shares , and British Telecom was 4 lower at 261 on turnover of 10 million shares .
39460	In other European markets , share prices closed sharply higher in Frankfurt and Zurich and posted moderate rises in Stockholm , Amsterdam and Milan .
39461	Paris closed lower , and most Brussels shares were unable to trade for a second consecutive day because of technical problems .
39463	Elsewhere , share prices rebounded in Hong Kong , Sydney , Singapore , Wellington , Taipei , Manila and Seoul .
39464	In Hong Kong , Sydney and Singapore -- the largest of those exchanges -- stocks recovered one-third to one-half of the ground they lost in Monday 's plunge , with major market indexes posting gains of 3.6 % to 4.4 % .
39469	The projects include construction of a 29,400 kilowatt waste-to-energy plant for Ada Cogeneration L.P. , Ada , Mich. ; a steam generating plant at Ontario , Calif. , that Zurn will own and operate , and two waste-water control projects in Orange County , Calif .
39470	AVX Corp. and Unitrode Corp. said they completed the previously reported sale of Unitrode 's San Diego-based Passive Components division to AVX .
39472	Passive Components makes capacitors and filters used to protect electronics .
39473	Consolidated Papers Inc. said it plans to spend $ 495 million on new paper-manufacturing equipment and facilities .
39474	The producer of paper used in magazines and by commercial printers said spending on the expansion is planned to begin in the first quarter of 1990 .
39475	The expansion is subject to approval by federal and Wisconsin environmental regulators .
39482	Called a `` married put , '' the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock .
39484	Because a put option gives its owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date , the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price .
39488	`` You always want your house insured , but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured . ''
39491	-- If the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date , the put will probably expire worthless .
39492	The investor will be out the cost of the put , which is called the `` premium , '' and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit .
39493	-- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date , the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put , less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put .
39496	Once the stock price is less than the exercise price , or `` strike price , '' of the put , the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar .
39498	When a stock falls below the put 's strike price , the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit .
39499	Or , the investor can exercise the put , by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock .
39503	For example , Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents , which would be received before the February option expires and , thus , reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount .
39505	To simplify the calculations , commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table .
39506	There are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold , including some over-the-counter stocks .
39511	Unlike options on individual issues , index options are settled only in cash , and no stock is ever tendered .
39514	As a result , the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline .
39515	In addition , OEX options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon , after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the S&P-500 futures contract was halted .
39528	These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock .
39535	Now those items will be discussed in a House-Senate conference , which could begin as soon as today , with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation .
39539	Senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President Bush by the end of the week , but Speaker Foley said that was n't likely .
39546	McCormick Capital Inc. said its tender offer to buy back as many as 1.1 million , or 44 % , of its common shares at $ 3 apiece , which expired Friday evening , was oversubscribed .
39547	The developer and manager of futures-investment limited partnerships said preliminary results indicate that about 1,749,000 shares had been tendered , giving a preliminary proration factor of 0.6287 .
39550	Under a proposed two-step amalgamation involving share swaps , ABM Gold Corp. , a gold exploration and management company , will merge with Neptune Resources Corp. , United Gold Corp. and Inca Resources Inc .
39552	Northgate said it will own about 50 % of the equity and 81 % of the votes of ABM after the amalgamation .
39553	The amalgamations are subject to regulatory approval and require approval by shareholders of ABM , Inca , United and Neptune at special meetings on Nov. 10 .
39554	Steven C. Walker , senior vice president of this bank holding company , was named president , chief executive officer and a director of both Commercial National and Commercial National Bank .
39558	The other , called the Solo , is battery operated and is the first high-performance radar detector that does n't need a power cord , the company said .
39559	A surprising surge in the U.S. trade deficit raised fears that the nation 's export drive has stalled , and caused new turmoil in financial markets .
39560	The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $ 10.77 billion , the Commerce Department reported , a sharp deterioration from July 's $ 8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this year .
39563	Like most analysts , Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month 's numbers ; but he said , `` It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we 've been led to believe . ''
39567	`` It raises questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them . ''
39574	And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the deficit was `` an unwelcome increase , '' adding that `` we 're hopeful that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around . ''
39577	`` That 's still an improvement over last year , but it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit . ''
39580	Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's , but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month .
39582	That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export .
39583	`` People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson .
39584	In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness .
39588	But they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down .
39589	`` The best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and Congress get serious about putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing , '' said Howard Lewis , vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers .
39591	August 's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies , capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles , parts and engines .
39598	Mr. Jobs moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's drawbacks yesterday by lowering the entry-level price for a Next machine by $ 1,500 , or 23 % , if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to Next 's optical-storage device .
39600	Mr. Jobs , co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. , founded Next four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used .
39601	His Next computer , introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users , sports snazzy graphics , digital sound , built-in networking and a sleek black design .
39602	But the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price , a lack of software and an optical data-storage device that was too slow .
39607	A computer with the optical device will still cost $ 6,495 , but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought Next machines .
39611	Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer .
39617	He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives , but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices .
39618	But university computer specialists , who welcomed the move , called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase Next 's sales on campuses .
39624	Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks , but the Next computer does n't come with a device that reads them .
39625	Next 's computer also needs more software applications , but Mr. Jobs said he expects more soon .
39629	Next wo n't comment on when it will do the same , but is believed to have a color model under development .
39630	Donald J. Amaral , 37 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of this owner and operator of hospitals , nursing centers and retirement hotels .
39631	He succeeds as president , Don Freeberg , who remains chairman and chief executive officer .
39633	Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a net loss of $ 19.4 million , or 74 cents a share , for the third quarter , which was burdened by severance costs and the expense of upgrading its database software inventories .
39635	This contrasts with the year-ago quarter , when the company had net income of $ 11.7 million , or 45 cents a share , on revenue of $ 75.7 million .
39636	For the nine months , Ashton-Tate had a loss of $ 27.6 million , or $ 1.05 a share .
39637	In the year-ago period , the company had profit of $ 34.3 million , or $ 1.32 a share .
39639	Edward M. Esber , chairman , president and chief executive officer , attributed the decline to reduced domestic revenue because of $ 4.9 million spent to upgrade existing software inventories to the new database IV Version 1.1 , and $ 1.8 million spent on the recent reduction in work force .
39641	The red ink came as no surprise to Wall Street , but analysts said they saw ominous hints of a further delay in volume shipments of Version 1.1 , a harbinger of continued losses in the fourth quarter .
39643	He added gross margins and operating profit `` eroded quite dramatically '' from the prior quarter , along with sales of existing software product lines like Multimate and Framework .
39654	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
39687	The chemicals and insurance company said net in the latest quarter was $ 54.8 million , or 45 cents a share .
39688	In the year-earlier quarter , net was $ 62.2 million , or 51 cents a share .
39693	The company 's chemicals interests include , among other things , petroleum additives , pharmaceuticals ingredients and polysilicon used by the semiconductor industry .
39694	For the nine months , Ethyl said net fell 2 % to $ 168.7 million , or $ 1.40 a share , from $ 172.2 million , $ 1.42 a share , a year ago .
39695	Net in the latest period included $ 11.9 million from discontinued operations and a charge of $ 6.2 million from a plant closing .
39699	Tribune Co. , helped by a hefty boost in performance at its broadcasting and entertainment operations , said net income jumped 21 % in its third quarter ended Sept. 24 on a 3 % increase in revenue .
39700	The broadcasting and newspaper concern , based in Chicago , said net was $ 62.7 million , or 77 cents a primary share , up from $ 51.6 million , or 69 cents a share .
39703	Nine-month net climbed 19 % to $ 174.8 million , or $ 2.21 a primary share , from $ 147.5 million , or $ 1.94 a share .
39707	Enserch Corp. said about 12 million , or 93 % , of the publicly traded units of its limited partnership , Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd. , were tendered in response to an offer that expired Monday .
39710	Enserch had offered one-half a share of its common and $ 1 in cash for each unit .
39711	The public sector borrowing requirement , the most widely used measure of Britain 's government deficit or surplus , showed a deficit of # 200 million in September , compared with a deficit of # 765 million in August and a deficit of # 1.08 billion in September 1988 , the Treasury said .
39719	As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an `` amiable agreement , '' Prospect Group will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment .
39720	In a management restructuring , Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman , chief executive and a director , while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director .
39722	Thomas M. Hurley and Robert A. Vanourek , who had been designated to take over Recognition 's top spots had Prospect 's tender offer succeeded , were named co-chief executives and directors .
39723	Mr. Hurley was formerly a vice president and general manager of an Avery International division ; Mr. Vanourek was a former group vice president of Pitney Bowes Inc .
39725	Also named to the revised board was Thomas A. Loose , Recognition 's senior vice president and general counsel .
39729	Beyond that , Prospect said it would n't offer to acquire additional shares for less than $ 11.25 a share during the next year or less than $ 14.06 a share during the subsequent two years .
39730	Recognition also said it obtained a commitment from Chemical Bank and Bank of Boston to convert an estimated $ 18 million in bank debt to a new , 24-month secured term loan to be repaid through the sale of certain assets .
39732	The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives , William G. Moore Jr. and Robert W. Reedy .
39733	The former executives were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to efforts by the company to win $ 400 million in Postal Service contracts .
39738	Sluggish sales of the Beretta , and its four-door sister car , the Corsica , prompted GM to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month .
39739	The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet , but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6 % for the year , and fell a steep 34 % during early October .
39742	Chevrolet buyers can take the rebate , or get discount financing at rates ranging from 6.9 % on 24-month loans to 10.9 % on 60-month loans .
39744	Except to characterize its offer as `` fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders , '' StatesWest declined to discuss details of its proposal .
39746	A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it .
39747	Last week , Mesa rejected a proposal by StatesWest to acquire it or merge .
39748	StatesWest has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas .
39749	StatesWest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft , connecting 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada .
39752	Roderick D. Reed III , who was also chief operating officer of FirstSouth , could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
39754	Mr. Reed admitted he conspired to conceal an agreement not to enforce loan guarantees executed by Dallas real-estate developers A. Starke Taylor III and George S. Watson , both of whom were FirstSouth stockholders .
39755	Neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Watson have been charged with criminal wrongdoing .
39756	By concealing the non-enforcement agreement , certain transactions with Messrs. Taylor and Watson were entered on FirstSouth 's books as loans , allowing the thrift to report fees and interest as current income , according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Little Rock , Ark .
39757	The conspiracy was part of an effort by Mr. Reed to hide FirstSouth 's shaky financial condition from federal regulators , according to federal prosecutors and regulators .
39758	The $ 1.68 billion thrift was declared insolvent and closed in December 1986 .
39759	FirstSouth 's former chairman and chief executive officer , Howard Weichern , is also charged with conspiring to conceal the agreements with Messrs. Watson and Taylor .
39763	I had underestimated , however , both Mr. Gelbart 's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington .
39765	In fact , at one point Merry Chase -LRB- Melinda Mullins -RRB- , a cool , carefully coiffed television announcer , recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years , concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry .
39766	Onstage , a congressional hearing is in progress , complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background .
39767	The witness table is center stage and below it , the paraphernalia for the ever-present media , in this case TNN , the Total News Network .
39768	Not only are there camera operators on all sides , but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater .
39770	Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing -- the witnesses , the lawyers , the interrogators and the news media -- are performers .
39772	The man , it seems , has a Lichtenstein corporation , licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas .
39775	Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI , but before it can , a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter , the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency .
39777	Soon the studio is producing a $ 40 million picture called `` Tet , the Motion Picture , '' to distinguish it from `` Tet , the Offensive , '' as well as `` Tet , the Book '' and `` Tet , the Album . ''
39780	Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings .
39781	Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; Jeff Weiss is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle ; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers ; Joseph Daly has the perfect `` aw , shucks '' demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president ; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses ' wives .
39782	With one she is pregnant , with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag , and as the vice president 's wife she rushes in with white hair , wearing a tailored suit and pearls , imitating Barbara Bush 's gestures down to the last detail .
39783	Though it 's clear that Mr. Gelbart 's sympathies do not lie with the far right , it 's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs , taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media .
39785	`` Mastergate '' is subtitled `` a play on words , '' and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone .
39786	He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a `` meteoric disappearance '' and found himself `` handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . ''
39787	This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness , however .
39788	Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation , the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides .
39789	As the hearings begin , the self-important Sen. Bowman -LRB- Jerome Kilty -RRB- announces : `` Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset : We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape . ''
39790	Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese : `` Without further monetary-stroke-military aid , scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers , who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us , were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle . ''
39792	The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so , as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart 's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably .
39793	Most of the evening , though , is filled with rare and welcome wit .
39794	In `` Mastergate , '' Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater : sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language .
39795	The Federal National Mortgage Association set up a three-member office of the chairman and elected James A. Johnson as vice chairman , effective Jan. 1 .
39796	Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since 1985 , and before that was president of Public Strategies , a Washington consulting firm .
39797	He is well-known in Democratic circles , having been executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of Mr. Mondale 's 1984 presidential campaign .
39798	At Fannie Mae , he will take responsibility for the corporation 's financial and legal areas and will work with David Maxwell , chairman and chief executive officer , and Roger Birk , president and chief operating officer , on strategic planning .
39800	In an interview , he said Fannie Mae faces a number of challenges with the restructuring of the thrift industry and the push to broaden its activities overseas .
39802	Fannie Mae also said James A. Aliber , chairman of First Federal of Michigan and a director since 1985 , moved up the date of his retirement from the board to accommodate Mr. Johnson 's election as a director .
39803	The board has 13 members elected by holders and five presidential appointees .
39804	Fannie Mae , a federally chartered , shareholder-owned corporation , operates a secondary market for mortgage loans , buying loans from lenders , packaging some into securities for sale to investors and keeping the rest in its portfolio .
39805	`` The New Crowd '' by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld -LRB- Little , Brown , 444 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , describes the displacing of the old `` our crowd '' Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg , Carl Icahn , Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein .
39808	The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing , and Susan Gutfreund used to turn off its light , to give the impression that there was no higher floor .
39814	Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $ 1 million garage in Paris , the Postels had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees , and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $ 35 million lawsuit .
39817	The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal , and put to work as a trader , and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator .
39819	Rising in the firm , he became powerful and bland , though his new wife , Susan , made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks .
39820	After he had been head of the company for 3 1\/2 years , he and his partners sold it to Phibro , a powerful commodity trading outfit , for $ 550 million in Phibro stock .
39821	Limited partner Billy Salomon , whose family name had been on the firm 's door for 70 years and who had hoped it would be there forever , was not consulted .
39825	Its profits , unlike Phibro 's , soared over the next two years , and had it held out , Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle .
39826	The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at Lehman Bros. and other grand old firms .
39827	Often the genteel , conservative , long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders : `` When angered , he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits , '' the authors say of Lehman 's Lewis Glucksman .
39828	The earlier generation of `` our crowd '' bankers -- Belmonts , Warburgs , Lehmans , Baches and Schiffs -- had stressed above all probity , tradition , continuity and reputation .
39830	But in the harsh world of today 's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors .
39831	The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs .
39835	-LRB- A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled , `` Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms . '' -RRB-
39836	Their other staple has been corporate takeovers , often hostile and financed by junk bonds .
39838	Sometimes they are constructive , but often not .
39843	As described in `` The New Crowd , '' they take on ambitious new wives , move to Greenwich , Conn. , or Bedford , N.Y. , buy OK pictures , and let their wives share the wealth with decorators .
39847	If those who have the money do n't get involved with the museums and the charities , then City Hall will do it , badly .
39849	A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal , and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines :
39850	Ivan Boesky , Dennis Levine , Martin Siegel , Victor and Steven Posner , and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley .
39851	The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and `` Pinky '' Green , today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences .
39854	It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in , and that a few will cut corners in the process .

39861	Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons said he raised his stake in Lockheed Corp. to 10.62 % from 10.43 % of the aerospace and electronics concern 's common shares .
39862	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Simmons said he and companies he controls , NL Industries Inc. and NL Chemicals Inc. , hold 6,744,600 shares of Lockheed , of Calabasas , Calif .
39863	They include 122,700 shares bought Friday for between $ 47.125 and $ 48 each .
39867	Valhi said the articles did n't accurately reflect Valhi and its affiliates ' intentions toward Lockheed .
39868	Instead , Valhi said , they may increase , decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings , depending on a number of conditions .
39872	U.S. exports benefited in August from heavy Canadian spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in Canadian auto demand , Canadian officials said .
39873	The U.S. and Canada , which do more trade than any other pair of nations , are to meet next month to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement .
39876	The remainder were to be phased out in five or 10 annual installments , with all tariffs eliminated by January 1998 .
39878	Canadian officials said the trade pact has kindled an export interest among many small Canadian companies that previously had little or no foreign sales .
39880	The businessmen are introduced to potential agents and distributors and instructed in trade procedures .
39883	The Canadian government also has recently opened new trade offices in San Diego ; San Juan , Puerto Rico ; Miami ; Princeton , N.J. , and Denver , bringing the total number of such Canadian offices in the U.S. to 27 .
39885	Canada 's export effort has been blunted by robust home market demand and by an 18 % appreciation of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart in the past three years that has made Canadian goods more costly in the U.S. .

39901	Bank of New England Corp. , seeking to streamline its business after a year of weak earnings and mounting loan problems , said it will sell some operations and lay off 4 % of its work force .
39902	The bank holding company also reported that third-quarter profit dropped 41 % , to $ 42.7 million , or 61 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 72.3 million , or $ 1.04 a share .
39903	Among its restructuring measures , the company said it plans to sell 53 of its 453 branch offices and to lay off 800 employees .
39905	Walter Connolly , chairman , said in an interview that the company expects to record pretax gains of $ 100 million to $ 125 million from the sale of its leasing operations and of certain financial processing services .
39907	Nonperforming assets continued to pile up in the latest quarter , rising to $ 900 million , or 3.52 % of loans and leases , from $ 667 million , or 2.68 % , at the end of the second quarter .
39908	Some $ 170 million of the $ 233 million increase in nonperforming loans was related to real estate , and roughly three-quarters of that was in the troubled New England market , according to Richard Driscoll , vice chairman .
39914	Among other restructuring measures , the bank said it will close its loan production offices in Chicago , New York and Philadelphia .
39916	In an internal memorandum to employees , Messrs. Connolly and Driscoll described the restructuring as an effort to continue rationalizing operations assembled during a series of mergers over the past five years .
39917	Italy 's wholesale price index rose 0.4 % in August from July and was up 6.1 % from a year earlier , the state statistical institute reported .
39918	The index registered 196.1 in August , compared with 195.4 in July and with 184.9 in August 1988 .
39920	The index has a base of 100 set in 1980 and is n't seasonally adjusted .
39921	U.S. steel imports in August fell 14 % from a year earlier to 1,531,000 tons , according to the American Iron and Steel Institute .
39922	The trade group 's compilation of Commerce Department data showed that August imports , the second largest monthly total of the year , were up 5 % from July 's 1,458,000 tons but below last year 's high of 1,979,000 tons in June 1988 .
39923	August imports claimed 18.5 % of the U.S. market , compared with 19.3 % in July and 20.5 % in August 1988 .
39929	`` Equipment orders on the domestic side were particularly strong in shipping and power utilities , '' said an agency official .
39931	In August , soon after Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a staggering $ 424.3 million loss and replaced its president , two Boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying : `` We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the ` Amazing Comeback at Wang . ' ''
39932	How soon Wang will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate .
39934	`` If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company , you 've lost it before you 've begun , '' says Mary Ann Cluggish , a Wellesley , Mass. , sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies .
39936	Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or Exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill .
39939	Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts .
39940	Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers .
39941	Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising .
39942	After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter , Wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as `` How could you not have known you were going to lose $ 55 million ? '' and `` Is Wang still a viable company ? ''
39943	Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances .
39949	Instead , he says , if the salespeople can get the customers to consider Wang 's products on their merits , he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances .
39952	Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to Wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load .
39953	Mr. Miller says that after a sharp sales slump in July and August , sales stabilized in September .
39954	Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year , Mr. Miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter .
39956	`` If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says George Palmatier , a Minden , Nev. , sales consultant and author of `` The Marketing Edge . ''
39957	Still , says John Sullivan , a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston , who has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari : `` The customer will react to strength .
39961	Wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come .
39967	During the past year , Wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president .
39968	Wang 's overall product line is `` still not as good as other vendors , but they 've come a long way , '' says Steven Wendler , a consultant with market researcher Gartner Group , Stamford , Conn .
39971	Wang 's installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal .
39973	One Wang salesman who left the company in July recalls that when he tried to sell products to Eastman Kodak , he worked `` to muster support from internal allies , '' but `` those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend .
39975	New customers , the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to Wang 's long-term viability , are even tougher .
39985	Buyers have to rely on a supplier `` continually upgrading and replacing the product , '' he says .
39991	You think you can go out and turn things around .
39997	Paul Hellman , a Framingham , Mass. , sales and management consultant and author of `` Ready , Aim , You 're Hired , '' says : `` The bad news is , you 'll be rejected more .
40003	`` Look a customer right in the eye and say , ` I 'm glad to be at Wang .
40007	Mr. Blinder said the change was n't related to the brokerage 's recent troubles , which have included sharp declines in earnings , run-ins with the securities regulators and lawsuits by former customers .
40010	Net was $ 24 million , or $ 1.15 a share , up from $ 19 million , or 90 cents a share , a year earlier .
40013	The company said the gains were tied to volume increases and higher prices .
40014	The market for electrochemicals include the paper , water-purification and textile industries .
40015	The chemical segment had a $ 6 million gain on the sale of ammonia and urea businesses , which was offset by a $ 6 million charge for future environmental expenditures .
40016	Profit in Olin 's defense and ammunition segment rose to $ 8 million from $ 7 million .
40018	In the first nine months , net rose 21 % to $ 93 million , or $ 4.52 a share , from $ 77 million , or $ 3.62 a share a year ago .
40021	GTE Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. reported strong earnings gains to record levels for the third quarter .
40022	Southwestern Bell Corp. and Cincinnati Bell posted slight declines .
40024	GTE said net income rose 18 % , aided by higher long-distance calling volumes and an increase in telephone lines in service .
40025	Pretax operating profit from telephone operations rose 8.2 % but profits from telecommunications products and electrical products were flat .
40027	The company said the quarter included a 10 % increase in local-exchange usage for long-distance calling and a 5 % increase in the number of access lines in service .
40028	Earlier rate reductions in Texas and California reduced the quarter 's revenue and operating profit $ 55 million ; a year earlier , operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization .
40029	Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27 % to $ 728.8 million , but operating profit was unchanged at $ 26.3 million , partly because of start-up expenses .
40030	Electrical products ' sales fell to $ 496.7 million from $ 504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in Europe and South America .
40036	Operating profit grew 57 % to $ 269 million from $ 171 million , while operating margins rose to 16.1 % from 15.9 % the previous quarter and 12.6 % a year ago .
40041	The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with American Telephone & Telegraph 's Reach Out America plan .
40042	MCI claims about 12 % of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10 % of the $ 23 billion residential market .
40045	Mr. Akerson said MCI recorded `` another solid cash positive quarter , '' its fourth in a row , but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition .
40047	We think revenue will continue to grow and that we can control costs and thus improve profitability . ''
40049	Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7 % , mainly the result of four extraordinary items : a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year ; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third ; a rate refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues .
40052	Chairman Zane E. Barnes said Southwestern Bell 's `` businesses are healthy and are continuing to grow . ''
40053	The company reported a 3.1 % increase in the number of access lines in service , and also said its Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems unit added 30,000 new customers , with a current total of about 333,000 .
40065	These include , among other parts , each jetliner 's two major bulkheads , a pressure floor , torque box , fixed leading edges for the wings and an aft keel beam .
40067	Rockwell , based in El Segundo , Calif. , is an aerospace , electronics , automotive and graphics concern .
40072	Thomas E. Meador , 42 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co. , a Skokie , Ill. , subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm .
40075	In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties , Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management .
40078	Great American Bank , citing depressed Arizona real estate prices , posted a third-quarter loss of $ 59.4 million , or $ 2.48 a share .
40079	A year earlier , the savings bank had earnings of $ 8.1 million , or 33 cents a share .
40080	For the nine months , it had a loss of $ 58.3 million , or $ 2.44 a share , after earnings of $ 29.5 million , or $ 1.20 a share , in the 1988 period .
40081	Great American said it increased its loan-loss reserves by $ 93 million after reviewing its loan portfolio , raising its total loan and real estate reserves to $ 217 million .
40084	In addition to the increased reserve , the savings bank took a special charge of $ 5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters , and it posted a $ 7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees , reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages .
40086	Look at what happened to UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , and its chief financial officer , John C. Pope .
40087	On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp , Messrs. Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL , United 's parent company , dived $ 24.875 on the Big Board to close at $ 198 .
40088	Including Monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ 49.5 million , based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at $ 300 a share .
40091	Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ 83.3125 each .
40095	He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $ 22 million , and UAL gave him a $ 15 million bonus when it hired him .
40098	United paid him a $ 375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines , and he was paid a salary of $ 342,122 last year with a $ 280,000 bonus .
40099	Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $ 69 each .
40100	That came to a combined $ 37.7 million under the $ 300-a-share buy-out , but just $ 21.3 million at yesterday 's close .
40102	United 's directors voted themselves , and their spouses , lifetime access to the Friendly Skies -- free first-class travel , and $ 20,000 a year for life as well .
40104	Thomas H. Johnson , president of the Coatedboard division of Mead Corp. , was named president of Manville Forest Products Corp. , a Manville unit , and senior vice president of Manville Corp .
40106	Manville is a building and forest products concern .
40111	He will also remain a director , US Facilities said , but wo n't serve on any board committees .
40112	Mr. Percival will be succeeded on an interim basis by George Kadonada , US Facilities chairman and president .
40118	Merck & Co. reported a 25 % increase in earnings ; Warner-Lambert Co. 's profit rose 22 % and Eli Lilly & Co. 's net income rose 24 % .
40121	Merck , Rahway , N.J. , continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health-products segment .
40122	A stronger U.S. dollar reduced third-quarter and first-nine-month sales growth 2 % and 3 % , respectively .
40127	Intense competition , however , led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck 's established human and animal-health products , including Aldomet and Indocin .
40130	Warner-Lambert , Morris Plains , N.J. , reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of 20 % or more per-share earnings growth .
40134	The segment 's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs Lopid , a lipid regulator , and Dilzem , a calcium channel blocker .
40135	World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert 's non-prescription health-care products , such as Halls cough tablets , Rolaids antacid , and Lubriderm skin lotion , increased 3 % to $ 362 million in the third quarter ; U.S. sales rose 5 % .
40137	World-wide sales of Trident gum , Certs breath mints , and Clorets gum and breath mints , increased 12 % to $ 277 million .
40140	Lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals , medical instruments and plant-science products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad .
40141	Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate , profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from Faberge Inc. in connection with Lilly 's sale of Elizabeth Arden Inc. in 1987 , and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at Lilly 's Hybritech Inc. unit .
40145	Higher sales of pesticides and other plant-science products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of animal-health products to fuel the increase in world-wide agricultural product sales , Lilly said .
40146	Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. units led growth in the medical-instrument systems division .
40148	Reuben Mark , chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co. , said he is `` comfortable '' with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $ 1.05 a share .
40150	The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company 's net income , increased to between $ 69.5 million and $ 76 million , from $ 47.1 million the year-before period .
40152	Mr. Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America , Asia and Europe .
40154	Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25 % in the quarter , Mr. Mark added .
40155	He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities .
40157	Colgate 's household products business , which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser , has been a weak performer .
40158	Analysts estimate Colgate 's sales of household products in the U.S. were flat for the quarter , and they estimated operating margins at only 1 % to 3 % .
40159	`` If you could say their business in the U.S. was mediocre , but great everywhere else , that would be fine , '' says Bonita Austin , an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co .
40162	`` We 've done a lot to improve -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- results , and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said .
40165	H. Anthony Ittleson was elected a director of this company , which primarily has interests in radio and television stations , increasing the number of seats to five .
40166	Osborn also operates Muzak franchises , entertainment properties and small cable-television systems .
40168	The Boston Globe says its newly redesigned pages have a `` crisper '' look with revamped fixtures aimed at making the paper `` more consistent '' and `` easier to read . ''
40170	Beantown scribes , who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as Michael `` Pee Wee '' Dukakis , or New England Patriots Coach Raymond `` Rev. Ray '' Berry , yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week .
40172	For a few days at least , he says , no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns .
40176	`` I thought -LCB- the drawing -RCB- a cross between someone you 'd spot whipping open his trench coat ... or a guy who boasted he 'd been Charles Manson 's roommate for the last 19 years , '' he said .
40177	Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden -LRB- `` appears to be a pervert '' -RRB- , Will McDonough -LRB- `` looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln '' -RRB- or Bella English , whose `` little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper . ''
40179	Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr , who usually rails at Statehouse `` hacks '' and nepotism , argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr. Madden 's `` rapidly growing forehead '' and the facial defects of `` chinless '' Dan Shaughnessy , a Globe sports columnist .
40182	Deeply ingrained in both the book review `` Kissing Nature Good-bye '' by Stephen MacDonald -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 27 -RRB- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity .
40187	Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America , northern Europe and Asia .
40188	This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves .
40190	It is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present-day global warming .
40191	I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage , but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion .
40194	In addition , the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency : a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world .
40196	IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion and collects about $ 1 trillion a year .
40197	`` My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' Mr. Goldberg said .
40198	`` And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ 5 billion properly . ''
40199	Mr. Goldberg , who took over as head of the IRS in July , has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency .
40203	`` I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said .
40205	Customarily , it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency , but Mr. Goldberg said he plans to `` scour the world '' for the chief information officer and the comptroller .
40206	Although the jobs will probably pay between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000 a year , IRS officials are confident that they can attract top-notch candidates from the private sector .
40207	`` You 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever , '' Mr. Goldberg said .
40208	`` On the comptroller side , you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a $ 6 billion budget .
40209	When Maj. Moises Giroldi , the leader of the abortive coup in Panama , was buried , his body bore several gunshot wounds , a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs .
40211	The rebel officer 's slow and painful death , at the headquarters of Panama 's Battalion-2000 squad , was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega , says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports .
40212	Leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup , according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City .
40214	His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress , Vicky Amado , and her mother , Norma .
40218	Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades .
40220	Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates .
40222	In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period .
40224	But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away .
40227	The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .
40228	The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran , as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier .
40230	And out of necessity : The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life .
40234	Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama 's dire economic situation , says Mr. Moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement .
40235	`` If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through 1988 , '' Mr. Moss contends .
40241	His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses .
40242	Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation .
40245	Luis Carlos , knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer , relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors .
40247	It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega , who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face .
40249	Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate .
40251	In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , French-made uniform , Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life , friends from the period say .
40252	`` He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism , where officers were the elite with special privileges , '' recalls Darien Ayala , a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend .
40253	Mr. Noriega 's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials say .
40255	The spy network would serve two clients : the Panamanian government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the U.S. , by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co. 's banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles .
40258	Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says .
40259	It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly .
40260	`` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation .
40263	By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
40272	Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . ''
40274	Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices .
40275	Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office .
40278	He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret .
40280	Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely .
40282	He became Gen. Torrijos 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama 's secrets .
40283	Mr. Noriega , by now a lieutenant colonel , expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis , the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking .
40285	`` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 .
40297	For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. Turner says .
40300	Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others .
40304	They included one of Mr. Noriega 's closest friends and business partners , Carlos Wittgreen .
40308	Dade County and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through Miami , made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil .
40315	Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen , the friend of Mr. Noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality .
40317	In January 1980 , Jerome Sanford , as assistant U.S. attorney , was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in Miami .
40322	`` Unfortunately , '' Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . ''
40326	In August 1983 , Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama , having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos .
40327	Soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses .
40329	Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA .
40331	During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas .
40332	He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges .
40338	`` Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin , '' he says .
40340	Curtin Windsor , then the ambassador to Costa Rica , recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula .
40343	He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a `` honey trap , '' in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event `` with sound and video . ''
40349	Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges .
40354	As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial , Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange `` for a promise to help clean up Noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces . ''
40356	The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things , just as Noriega had helped -LCB- the U.S. . -RCB- the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal . ''
40357	Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams , who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz .
40362	The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence .
40363	Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera , his former chief of staff , that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos .
40367	Now , neither side -- the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega -- has an easy out .
40369	Mr. Noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power .
40371	In the end , is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein 's monster , created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power ?
40374	That allowed him to get stronger and stronger , '' he says .
40375	`` I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him , nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong .
40376	UPJOHN Co. reported that third-quarter net income rose to $ 96 million , or 52 cents a share , from $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , a year earlier .
40379	The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 % in the third quarter , substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter .
40380	`` Capital spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said Robert Dederick , economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago .
40381	The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September , give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates .
40386	Factories operated at 83.7 % of capacity , the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1 % in September .
40399	Robin Honiss , president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company , was elected to the additional posts of chairman , president and chief executive of the company 's New England Savings Bank subsidiary .
40403	The drop is particularly large for white males , although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates .
40406	`` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore .
40407	The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart .
40408	The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % .
40410	The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites .
40411	The study , by Susan Devesa , William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute 's staff , also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket , except black men .
40412	Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole , the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women .
40413	Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55 , with sharp increases for everybody but white men .
40416	`` Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups , they ca n't be taken for granted , '' the report says .
40417	`` Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , adolescents and minorities . ''
40418	An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality `` among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ 2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking . ''
40419	But the editorial , by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization , notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries .
40420	`` Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education .
40422	According to the American Cancer Society , smoking is responsible for 85 % of the lung-cancer cases among men and 75 % among women .
40425	While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke , in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks .
40426	In comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade , the NCI study looked only at blacks and whites .
40427	Asians and native Americans were n't studied ; Hispanics were included with whites .
40428	Recent changes in average annual age-specific lung-cancer rates per 100,000 population by race and sex .
40434	As vice president\/national-government relations , Mr. Womack will work with P&G 's top management and with the company 's government-relations staff `` to represent P&G 's interests at the federal level , '' said John G. Smale , chairman and chief executive officer .
40436	Mr. Womack , 53 years old , has been with the big producer of household products , food and pharmaceuticals for 30 years .
40439	The forces at work included computer-guided trading , as well as profit-driven market makers and institutional investors who had bought stock on the cheap during the recent correction .
40441	The Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.05 , or 0.2 % , to 459.93 .
40442	The action was confined to Nasdaq 's biggest and most liquid stocks , traders said .
40443	The Nasdaq 100 Index began the day at 449.89 , lost 2 % at one point , and was up 0.4 % at another .
40447	`` The market must have turned up and down 15 different times , '' commented Lance Zipper , head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody .
40448	`` Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up , and every time you thought it would rally it came down .
40451	Most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit , he and other traders said .
40452	`` Everybody 's confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds , '' said Mr. Zipper .
40453	`` A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth .
40457	Program trading is `` benefiting a few to the detriment of many and I wish someone would do something about it , '' he complained .
40460	Advancing and declining issues finished about even .
40461	Of the 4,345 stocks that changed hands , 1,174 declined and 1,040 advanced .
40463	The stock , which finished Monday at 29 1\/2 , traded as high as 29 3\/4 and as low as 28 3\/4 before closing at 29 1\/4 , down 1\/4 .
40470	The wholesaler of cash and carry merchandise reported fiscal fourthquarter earnings that were better than analysts had expected .
40485	Robert M. Jelenic , 39 , was named president and chief operating officer of this closely held publisher .
40488	In addition , Ralph Ingersoll II , 43 , chairman and chief executive , said he would take on additional responsibilities as editor in chief of the company .
40491	Also , Jean B. Clifton , 28 , was named executive vice president , treasurer and chief financial officer .
40494	Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism -LRB- `` Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet , '' by David Brooks , editorial page , Oct. 5 -RRB- .
40495	Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists .
40496	It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution .
40497	Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage - and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century .
40498	Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis .
40500	The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy , eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being .
40504	These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich , Barry Commoner , Rene Dubois and George Wald .
40505	Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years , and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985 .
40509	Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain , greenhouse warming and ozone depletion , all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense .
40511	Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution .
40512	But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation -LRB- which , they claim , depletes natural resources -RRB- and nuclear power -LRB- even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect -RRB- .
40513	They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering .
40514	New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power .
40518	First and foremost , the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment .
40519	Consider , for example , the greenhouse effect and climate change ; numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees , including one from the National Academy of Science , judge there is a greater than 50 % probability of a grave problem in the offing .
40523	Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change .
40525	If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues , that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism .
40527	We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere .
40528	This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems .
40529	The problems of the environment are so interrelated , so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years .
40534	Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth , the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to $ 12.7 million , or six cents a share , from $ 39.9 million , or 26 cents a share , the year earlier .
40540	The volume is well below the industry 's 4 % to 5 % growth rate of recent years , but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter .
40544	Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping .
40546	A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14 % increase in selling , administrative and general expenses -- to $ 324.9 million -- to marketing costs .
40548	For the nine months , Coca-Cola Enterprises ' net fell 31 % to $ 65 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ 93.8 million , or 63 cents a share .
40552	Separately , Purchase , N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. , as expected , said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11 % to $ 269.3 million , or $ 1.02 a share , from $ 241.6 million , or 91 cents a share .
40563	It is providing $ 50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as $ 75 million in receivables from B. Altman & Co. and Bonwit Teller , L.J. Hooker 's two fully owned department-store chains .
40564	Sam Merksamer , chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain , and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp. , both declined to comment .
40568	In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out , say those familiar with the situation .
40569	This year , a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed , causing jitters among suppliers , and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems .
40570	For the year ended June 30 , 1989 , Merksamer Jewelers had $ 62 million of revenue and operating profit of $ 2.5 million .
40572	According to those familiar with the situation , other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc .
40575	The company was founded in Sacramento in 1929 by two brothers , Ralph and Walter Merksamer , who operated as DeVon 's Jewelers .
40576	In 1979 , the pair split the company in half , with Walter and his son , Sam , agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name .
40578	As earlier reported , L.J. Hooker this week received a $ 409 million bid for its three shopping malls , plus other properties from a consortium led by Honolulu real-estate investor Jay Shidler and A. Boyd Simpson , an Atlanta developer and former L.J. Hooker senior executive .
40580	Robert J. Regal was named president and chief executive officer of this company 's Universal-Rundle Corp. unit .
40581	Mr. Regal had been president and chief executive of RBS Industries Inc .
40582	Robert H. Carlson , previous president and chief executive of Universal-Rundle , will assume the title of chairman of the unit , a vitreous-china maker .
40583	The days may be numbered for animated shows featuring Alf , the Karate Kid and the Chipmunks .
40584	NBC , a leader in morning , prime-time and late night programs but an also-ran on Saturday mornings , when children rule the TV set , is contemplating getting out of the cartoon business .
40586	`` There is talk of some revamping and we 're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation , '' said Joseph S. Cicero , vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Co. , a unit of General Electric Co .
40587	Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff , who declined to be interviewed , is `` looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season . ''
40590	One major NBC affiliate , KCRA in Sacramento , plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast .
40595	An NBC spokesman says the network will `` closely monitor '' the Sacramento situation , and says it is the only station to defect .
40596	Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , say there are no plans to alter the children 's line-up on Saturday mornings .
40598	There has been a surge in syndicated children 's shows to independent stations , as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel .
40602	NBC Productions or NBC News could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows , a move that would control costs .
40604	Rohm & Haas Co. said third-quarter net income skidded 35 % to $ 32.6 million , or 49 cents a share .
40605	In the year-earlier quarter , the chemicals company had net of $ 49.8 million , or 75 cents a share .
40611	For the nine months , Rohm & Haas net totaled $ 155 million , or $ 2.33 a share , down 17 % from $ 187.8 million , or $ 2.82 a share , a year ago .
40614	Michael A. Gaskin , 55 years old , was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots , succeeding Walter K. Weisel .
40615	Mr. Weisel , 49 , resigned as president and chief executive and will work on special projects , said John J. Wallace , chairman .
40616	Mr. Gaskin formerly was president and chief executive of Taylor & Gaskin Inc. and was a director of Prab Robots since 1985 .
40617	Stephen N. Wertheimer was named managing director and group head of investment banking in Asia , based in Tokyo .
40622	I did n't say this , and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote .
40623	I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs , levamisole and 5-fluorouracil , to any of my colon-cancer patients .
40624	With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer .
40626	I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients , both today and tomorrow , should offer the hope of something better than that .
40628	These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better .
40631	This hope , however , will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point .
40633	The oil and auto industries , united in their dislike of President Bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels , announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline .
40634	Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities ' air-pollution problems , with no bias toward any fuel in particular .
40635	However , their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure methanol -- the two front-running alternative fuels -- in tests to be completed by next summer .
40636	Instead , the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline , which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas .
40639	The initial $ 11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines , said Joe Colucci , head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories .
40641	A second phase of research , which is still being planned , will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars .
40643	`` The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers , '' said Keith McHenry , a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp .
40646	Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995 .
40648	The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill .
40652	The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr. , who is chairman of American Continental Corp. , Lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators .
40655	When Lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. Seidman .
40668	Sens. John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , John McCain , -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- and Alan Cranston -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln .
40676	Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , hired by creditors to consult on Eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval .
40679	She said they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base . ''
40680	At a later news conference here , Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. , said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled .
40683	`` We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' Mr. Lorenzo told reporters .
40684	`` We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he added .
40685	In July , Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size .
40686	But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle , its Philadelphia hub and various planes , Eastern hit a stumbling block .
40689	A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR , over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit , caused the deal to collapse .
40690	Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization .
40693	Since then , Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions .
40696	Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $ 100 million , and that Eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at yesterday 's session .
40698	The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .
40700	At the news conference , Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment .
40701	Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats .
40703	Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses , but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow .
40706	Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January .
40711	That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again .
40713	But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own .
40714	In any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes .
40721	Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser .
40726	But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next , Starr adds .
40729	It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until April 16 to choose .
40731	A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $ 100 and that the year 's total losses exceed 10 % of adjusted gross income ; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher .
40732	In filing an original -LRB- not amended -RRB- return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately .
40734	Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday , but the IRS says people in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` Hugo '' and postmarked by Jan. 16 .
40735	Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability .
40736	IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo 's victims .
40737	Among the provisions : Fiscal-year taxpayers with returns due last Monday wo n't be penalized if they file -- or request an extension -- and pay tax due by Nov. 15 .
40738	Excise-tax returns due by Oct. 31 or Nov. 30 may be delayed to Jan. 16 .
40739	Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment-tax returns due Oct. 31 or for depositing withheld taxes , but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by Nov. 15 .
40743	But the Tax Court said the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions .
40745	Estimating that the state may lose $ 15 million a year , officials announced the filing of 15 criminal actions and `` hundreds '' of civil penalties .
40746	WHEN AN IRA OWNER dies , the trustee of the individual retirement account must file forms 5498 reporting market values relating to the decedent and each beneficiary , with copies to the executor and beneficiaries .
40749	People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the IRS .
40751	But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income ; and the IRS said Brown must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $ 124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only $ 52,012 .
40753	The deposits came from savings kept in a Tupperware breadbox ; he saved $ 47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and $ 45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father , who had abandoned the family in 1955 .
40754	Brown had no proof ; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible .
40758	The court rejected his incredible claims , denied his deductions , and imposed a negligence penalty ... .

40762	This place is 12 miles into the back country -- a day-long trudge for a hiker , but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes .
40766	The animal had to be destroyed ; the bikers fled and were never found .
40767	In numerous parks near San Francisco , rangers have been forced to close trails , set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding .
40768	They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails .
40775	But the bikes ' burgeoning numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas , from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard , to ban them from the back country .
40776	Key to the issue is that the bikes , in skillful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror .
40778	Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians .
40789	Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no longer , for example , lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles .
40790	But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users .
40792	`` People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture , '' complains Mark Langton , associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park , Calif .
40793	Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers .
40795	To fight back , activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails .
40797	Biking groups in Montana , Idaho , Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions , says Tim Blumenthal , mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine .
40798	These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker 's image ; in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations , and to school riders in proper trail etiquette .
40800	While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through `` education and peer pressure , '' says Jim Hasenauer , a director of the International Mountain Biking Association .
40802	Few would have foreseen such a furor when , a decade ago , some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires , lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology .
40804	They got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage .
40809	City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes .
40812	The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week .
40814	David Lindsey , chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration , muses that the bike 's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia .
40815	`` The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the ` paperboy ' bike you had as a kid , but it can do so much more , '' he says .
40816	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
40819	H.F. Ahmanson & Co. , offering of four million shares of noncumulative convertible preferred stock , Series B. , via Goldman , Sachs & Co , First Boston Corp. , and Merrill Lynch .
40820	Shared Technologies Inc. , offering of 2.5 million common shares , via Smetek , Van Horn & Cormack Inc. and Oakes , Fitzwilliams & Co .
40822	Early yesterday , investors scrambled to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of Friday .
40824	That cut short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday 's levels .
40826	Long-term Treasury issues declined about half a point , or $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
40828	`` People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world did n't end Monday morning '' or yesterday .
40841	But several other traders contend investors have overreacted to junk-bond jitters , and that stock prices will continue to recover .
40846	Late yesterday in New York , the dollar rose to 142.75 yen from 141.80 yen Monday , but fell to 1.8667 marks from 1.8685 marks .
40847	The Consumer News and Business Channel cable network and U.S. News & World Report have formed a joint venture to produce cable program versions of special issues of the magazine .
40849	CNBC is a joint venture of the National Broadcasting Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , and Cablevision System Corp .
40850	Advertisers will be offered an advertising package , which for a single price , will include time on the CNBC program and ad pages in the special guides .
40853	Other programs and special issues will be based on themes of health , jobs , personal finance , the best colleges , and investments .
40854	The programs will be written and produced by CNBC , with background and research provided by staff from U.S. News & World Report .
40864	Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a one-time gain and strong wood-product sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15 % jump in third-quarter net income to $ 166.8 million , or 78 cents a share .
40865	In the 1988 third quarter , the forest-products company reported profit of $ 144.9 million , or 69 cents a share .
40867	For the nine months , the company posted a 14 % rise in profit to $ 469.8 million , or $ 2.21 a share , from $ 410.3 million , or $ 1.95 a share .
40869	Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $ 33 million from the company 's business improvement and refocusing program , and a gain of $ 49 million on the sale of a subsidiary 's common stock .
40870	Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter , while paper operations were dogged by higher costs , soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen .
40871	Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business .
40872	Weyerhaeuser 's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months , but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs , plus pricing of certain products , the company said .
40873	Looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak , while panel and plywood markets will be stronger .
40874	Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables , the company said .
40876	The bank also said it expects to report a $ 1.42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year .
40877	The new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to Third World countries to $ 2.6 billion , or 85 % of Bankers Trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries .
40878	`` Step up to the plate and take the big swing .
40879	Get the problem behind you and do n't look back , '' said James J. McDermott , analyst at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , in approving of the move .
40888	`` There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire , '' said Carole Berger , analyst for C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc .
40891	Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were `` relatively flat , sometimes choppy , '' the bank said , and profit for the area sank 27 % .
40892	The cross-border loan portfolio reflected `` adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns , '' the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter , while Venezuela brought itself `` substantially current . ''
40894	`` People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a Citicorp spokesman said .
40897	A `` concerning '' item the analyst cited was the 10 % jump in expenses , which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business .
40900	Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks , minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13 % third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages .
40901	Its margin fell only seven basis points , or 7\/100ths of a percentage point , from a year ago , compared with a 13-point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country .
40902	As a result , Wells Fargo 's net interest income rose $ 36.3 million , or 7 % , to $ 537 million for the quarter .
40904	The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25 % return on average assets for the quarter , about 40 % higher than Security Pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S. .
40906	Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell 8 % from the previous quarter to $ 806.8 million from $ 880.9 million .
40907	But the amount was still 39 % higher than the year-ago level , and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans .
40908	That trend , and Wells Fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs , are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo 's financial picture .
40909	Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve , which increased to $ 711 million at Sept. 30 from $ 664 million the previous quarter but was down from $ 852 million a year ago , when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans .
40911	Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a one-time $ 16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company , third-quarter earnings were $ 75 million .
40913	The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations .
40914	The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain areas of wholesale banking .
40919	PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs .
40921	Trust income grew 15 % , to $ 49.9 million , while service charges , fees and commissions increased 22 % , to $ 79.4 million .
40922	The bank 's total allowance for credit losses was $ 502.1 million , or 1.82 % of total loans .
40923	Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party control of the government .
40924	Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties .
40925	Elections in this large , diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict .
40926	Much depends on the opposition , a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh .
40927	The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs , promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity .
40928	Yesterday , four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party , Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24 .
40931	The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress -LRB- I -RRB- , which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India 's 42 years of independence .
40934	His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics , including his own party , went unfulfilled .
40936	Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls .
40941	Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete , and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power .
40942	The Lok Sabha , or lower house of Parliament , has 542 elected and two appointed seats .
40945	Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs , and many Indians feared their country might split apart .
40948	In 1977 , Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in power , she was restored to office .
40950	But if the opposition remains fractured , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government .
40951	Chimanbhai Mehta , a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally , predicts Congress -LRB- I -RRB- will win only 150 seats , a quarter of the house , if the opposition fields single candidates in 80 % of the races .
40952	Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates .
40953	The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters .
40955	The contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs .
40959	The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills .
40961	In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government .
40962	That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power .
40963	His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has chalked up some successes .
40964	But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt .
40965	His failures in those two areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many Indians .
40967	`` The Congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support .
40969	The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party is the poor reputation of the opposition .
40971	When the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- lost the 1977 election , following Mrs. Gandhi 's hated emergency rule , a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated .
40984	Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament , `` ... neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions .
40989	The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India .
40991	A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company .
40993	The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government 's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal .
41001	Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc .
41002	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Parsow and Elkhorn , which together hold 8.685 % of CACI 's common shares , said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold .
41003	CACI , based in Arlington , Va. , said it had n't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment .
41004	The partnerships said they may seek board representation , and they may seek the support of CACI 's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans .
41005	According to the filing , Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn , Neb. , and are controlled by the same general partner , Alan S. Parsow .
41007	Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market , in private transactions or otherwise , depending on market conditions and other factors .
41008	The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices .
41010	In early trading , investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated .
41012	Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ 4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt .
41017	The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence .
41023	It ended at about 8 11\/16 % yesterday , but was as low as 8 1\/2 % Monday .
41024	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1\/2 point , or over $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield moved above 8 % for the first time since Thursday .
41025	Investment-grade corporate , municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell .
41034	Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering .
41035	Some traders estimate $ 9.75 billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week , and they expect Refcorp to offer $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion of long-term `` bailout '' bonds .
41051	TVA offered $ 2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield 9.06 % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42 % ; and $ 1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield 8.33 % .
41056	The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling $ 850 million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today .
41059	The two Remics priced were a $ 500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a $ 350 million Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets .
41060	The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities , which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off .
41061	Ginnie Mae 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 , down 7\/32 ; 9 1\/2 % securities at 99 31\/32 , down 6\/32 ; and 10 % securities at 101 29\/32 , down 5\/32 .
41073	As part of its College Savings Plan , Connecticut offered $ 100.4 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 .
41077	West German government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride , pulled down by Monday 's U.S. stock market gains then up by a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and falling U.S. stock prices .
41084	A House-Senate conference approved an estimated $ 67 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill that provides a 28 % increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market .
41086	Separately , the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners .
41089	By an 11-2 margin , Senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan , and despite powerful allies , the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives .
41090	The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11 % under the 235 program , and however disruptive to private investors , the refinancing is expected to yield at least $ 15 million in savings in fiscal 1990 .
41091	This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere , and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests .
41092	`` We are stewards here , not of the mortgage companies , but the taxpayers , '' said the Texas Republican .
41094	The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy , but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination .
41095	The Senate had refused late Friday to invoke cloture and limit debate , but behind the bipartisan leadership , a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties .
41096	Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt , but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators , including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn .
41097	The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring , but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party .
41098	Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing , and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's Supreme Electoral Council .
41099	Within the appropriations conference yesterday , the $ 67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science , housing , veterans and the environment .
41102	These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991 , and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects , including the first construction funds for the space station .
41103	The station is promised $ 1.8 billion within the $ 5.36 billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and the nation 's high-speed aerospace plane -- cut by the Senate -- could receive as much as $ 60 million in new funds or transfers .
41106	Among major domestic agencies , the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about $ 829.9 million .
41107	An estimated $ 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation , and within the Housing and Urban Development Department , more than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families .
41109	While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities .
41110	The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued at $ 8 million to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the House and Senate .
41112	An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska , but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered .
41113	Separately , a third conference report covering an $ 18.4 billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a 383-30 roll call yesterday .
41115	Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint .
41116	And among domestic programs , the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services .
41117	The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate , and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities .
41120	Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge .
41121	Gold , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness : The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market .
41122	The settlement prices of the December , February and April gold contracts were even with Monday 's final prices .
41125	According to one analyst , Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber , New York , the stock market 's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday 's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices , and out of gold 's , in particular .
41127	Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year : selling by gold producers , who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold .
41128	`` December delivery gold is trading in a range of $ 365 to $ 375 -LCB- an ounce -RCB- and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' Mr. Savaiko said .
41130	Also , Mr. Savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . ''
41132	`` Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the -LCB- Federal Reserve -RCB- in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock market rebound on Monday , '' he said .
41134	`` They still bear the memory of October 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. Nichols said .
41136	At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold . ''
41137	Dinsa Mehta , chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank , said : `` There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its ` flight to safety ' quality .
41141	`` I do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $ 10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so , '' he said .
41149	When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized , oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration .
41156	According to an analyst , Cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year , into early next year .
41157	`` Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar , '' the analyst said .
41161	The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said .
41162	LIVESTOCK AND MEATS :
41163	The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork .
41166	GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
41167	The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal .
41172	Ratings under review are Ryder 's A-1 collateral trust debentures , A-2 senior notes and bonds , A-2 preferred stock and the company 's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper .
41174	The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs , improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business , vehicle leasing and rental .
41176	But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better .
41181	Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise , but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down .
41193	Hardest hit by Hugo in South Carolina were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood .
41197	Local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms .
41198	`` It helps us , and people feel better talking to someone who 's gone through the same thing , '' an SBA official says .
41200	The Senate , after deleting Section 89 repeal from its deficit-reduction bill , still is expected to join the House in voting to kill the law , which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike .
41214	Sen. Strom Thurmond -LRB- R. , S.C . -RRB- protests pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling prisoner-made furniture and other goods to government agencies .
41218	Groups representing some independent auto-repair shops join a compromise on the Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep. Henry Waxman -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .
41219	The plan would increase the warranty on auto-emission systems to eight years or 80,000 miles from five years or 50,000 for major parts .
41220	But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or 24,000 miles .
41223	Shops represented by the Automotive Service Industry Association and the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association oppose any increase in warranty length .
41228	Some 70 % of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they 'd prefer to work in or own a small company , yet most take jobs with large concerns , says a survey by the Foster McKay Group , a New York recruiting firm ... .
41231	Banc One said `` it is contemplated '' that John B. McCoy , chairman and chief executive officer , will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney 's retirement .
41232	Mr. McKinney , 50 years old , was chairman and chief executive of American Fletcher Corp. , Indianapolis , when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January 1987 .
41234	Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corp. , the successor company to American Fletcher Corp. , but will no longer be active in day-to-day management .
41237	The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25 , 1990 , and April 26 , 1990 , respectively .
41238	Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
41240	The ratings concern said it downgraded Beatrice notes , Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single-B-1 from Ba-3 and the company 's subordinated debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2 .
41241	Moody 's said the proposed recaptilization may `` limit the company 's ability to realize its profit potential '' and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze `` basic business operations . ''
41243	Beatrice , which went private in an $ 8.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as $ 983 million in preferred stock and debt securities .
41250	Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R. , a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul , the refugees sit in their camps , and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever .
41251	But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily .
41252	Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did .
41253	The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance -- and did n't .
41255	The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid .
41260	Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime .
41263	By early May , Moscow had delivered , for example , 1,000 trucks , about 100 tanks , artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles .
41264	Later that month , it added an entire tank brigade , including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles .
41265	By September , a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles , 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar .
41266	In the last few weeks , Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles , the bomber version of the An-12 , MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft , MiG-29s , which can outfly Pakistan 's U.S.-built F16s , and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers , which can outfly the MiG-29s .
41269	But this is not the entire Afghan army , and it is no longer Kabul 's only military force .
41270	Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations ; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned .
41275	In preparation for the withdrawal , Moscow , Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel .
41281	Rep. Bill McCollum -LRB- R. , Fla. -RRB- reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms .
41283	In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public .
41286	At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces .
41287	The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime base .
41288	The resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves .
41289	Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime .
41292	The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime , but that it continues to exist and fight at all .
41293	Last summer , in response to congressional criticism , the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off ; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive .
41295	Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons .
41297	Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful .
41298	For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent , based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf .

41303	Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua 's Contra rebels , or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles .
41305	And , surprisingly , little more than a whimper of protest is being heard , even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative .
41307	Yet , he asserts , `` you look around ... and you say , ` Who are the leaders ?
41309	It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI .
41312	A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives , a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility .
41313	Above all , though , conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be receding .
41314	`` We want to complain , we want to say something about it , and we 're going to as it gets worse , '' says Rep. Dan Burton , an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer .
41318	Of course , neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI .
41322	Most analysts think there 's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms , and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best .
41324	The administration continues to support SDI , or Star Wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program .
41325	And just last week , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing `` compelling reasons '' to push ahead with SDI and saying he 'd urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with `` inadequate '' funding for the program .
41327	The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding , and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year .
41332	But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty .
41334	As a result , Frank Gaffney , a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy , charges that the administration 's `` professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity . ''
41335	Still , proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev .
41342	Above all , though , proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support .
41349	Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech `` thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory . ''
41355	He said that other participants in the conference `` do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual , '' but that `` I mean to persuade you to the opposite view . ''
41358	Rights on such a basis , whether for blacks or homosexuals , are `` mere indulgences , '' he said , subject to being taken back .
41360	His speech criticized the `` idiocy of notions of protected groups in society '' as opposed to individual equality or , as he put it , in `` a common destiny as Americans . ''
41361	Instead of lobbying for special treatment , Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk `` invidious retrenchment with government complicity . ''
41365	Mr. Allen , who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission , has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights .
41368	There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen 's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups .
41374	George L. LaMore , president and chief executive officer , will become chairman and chief executive upon Mr. Cunin 's retirement .
41375	John C. Dannemiller , executive vice president and chief operating officer , will become president and chief operating officer .
41376	Mr. Cunin , 65 years old , was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and power-transmission products from 1982 to 1988 .
41379	Mr. Dannemiller , 51 , joined Bearings in August 1988 from Leaseway Transportation Corp. , where he was president and chief operating officer .
41382	Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev opened a major U.S. trade exhibition in Moscow and spent two hours touring some of the 150 stalls representing such blue-chip companies as General Motors Corp. , International Business Machines Corp. and Johnson & Johnson .
41385	The exhibition by the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council underscores the growing U.S. interest in that nation 's market , though trade between the two countries is a minuscule $ 3 billion .
41386	The Soviet president and his prime minister , Nikolai Ryzhkov , spent the longest time , about 15 minutes , at the IBM stand , where they got souvenir computer-chip key rings .

41417	Polaroid Corp. , benefiting from staff-reduction savings , reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $ 29.9 million , or 40 cents a share , after preferred-stock requirements .
41418	Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations , partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation .
41419	However , they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment , and an indication that sales of Polaroid 's new conventional film in the U.S. have been sluggish .
41421	Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ 63.1 million for the third quarter , more than double the year-before $ 24 million .
41422	Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ 54.1 million , or 77 cents a share , in 1988 's third quarter .
41426	Sam Yanes , a Polaroid spokesman , said `` I do n't know about disappointing , '' but added that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise , discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already .
41427	Mr. Yanes said the film , One Film , is currently carried at about 15,000 retail outlets , including drugstores and supermarkets .
41428	For the nine months , Polaroid reported earnings of $ 98.5 million , or $ 1.27 a share .
41429	Last year , the company had a nine-month loss of $ 15.1 million , or 23 cents a share .
41434	And those swings paled beside Friday 's 190.58-point plunge and Monday 's 88.12-point recovery .
41438	There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness : new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options ; computer-driven strategies like program trading ; and crowd psychology .
41439	But most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly .
41440	Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert .
41442	`` We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators .
41445	Institutions -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink .
41449	Trading in futures and options , some people believe , can add to volatility .
41450	Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks ; that is , a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks .
41451	These and other modern trading methods `` tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets , '' says George Douglas , first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
41453	One new investment style called `` asset allocation '' shifts portfolio weightings between stocks , bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive .
41460	But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets .
41461	Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets .
41462	Others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures .
41463	Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch .
41476	`` It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit , '' said one Chicago-based futures trader .
41486	Hans Stoll , finance professor at Vanderbilt University , says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced .
41490	John J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the Big Board , asserts that `` 1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years . ''
41492	In addition , Sanford Grossman , a Wharton School finance professor , says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions `` who can go out and say ` I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell . ' ''
41497	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe , which is to be launched today .
41498	Charles Redmond , a NASA spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today .
41499	Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle , part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn .
41500	Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared `` garbage data could be substituted for real data . ''
41503	It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet , a much larger network used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government agencies around the world .
41505	A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks .
41507	NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms .
41510	If it finds one and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a user logs on that says , `` Worms Against Nuclear Killers ... .
41511	You talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war . ''
41512	In addition , Mr. Alexander said , the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as , `` George Orwell was an optimist , '' or `` Do n't feed the bats tonight . ''
41514	The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running .
41518	NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage , if any .
41520	Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode , or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet , fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere .
41521	So far Galileo has been delayed twice , once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine , and yesterday because of the weather .
41524	He said the Chaos Computer Club , of West Germany , once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi , messing up some calculations .
41526	Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts .
41527	Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers .
41529	In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur .
41532	In 1983 , the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision , which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain `` some personal gain '' and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact .
41533	Gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point .
41537	Hearing of this information , the husband discussed it with his broker , Mr. Chestman , and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients .
41546	Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and , on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker , responded : `` Well , your bunny has a good nose . ''
41552	Yet , all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue : Who is and who should be making the criminal law here ?
41553	It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness .
41555	But even if they behaved recklessly , reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading .
41556	Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors .
41558	When only civil liability is involved , this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization .
41560	When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule .
41564	In the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company , but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts .
41565	Today , after Mr. Freeman 's plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient .
41566	In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts .
41567	Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion -LRB- which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading -RRB- , judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions .
41569	The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime .
41572	At a stroke , this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches -LRB- and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee -RRB- .
41578	Corning Inc. posted a 38 % decline in third-quarter net income to $ 76.5 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 123.9 million , or $ 1.37 a share , a year earlier .
41580	Without the gain , operating profit was $ 64 million , or 71 cents a share .
41581	The telecommunications , specialty glass , ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of $ 600,000 .
41584	Corning 's chairman and chief executive officer , James R. Houghton , said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments .
41585	But the specialty-material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations .
41586	As for joint ventures , Mr. Houghton said profit was `` essentially flat '' due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China .
41591	Computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes .
41592	The lightning moves show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge .
41597	UAL was watched closely and traded heavily .
41599	The market is still very touchy about rumors and news on pending takeovers .
41601	An important element of this phenomenon -- the now-shaky market for junk bonds , used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a pall over stocks .
41604	This Friday brings the `` double witching hour , '' Wall Street 's nickname for the monthly simultaneous expiration of a variety of stock index futures , index options and options on individual stocks .
41606	Previous monthly expirations of the Major Market Index futures and Standard & Poor 's 100-stock index options have produced spectacular volatility .
41608	Investors were buying yesterday , but they were running scared to premier blue chips such as Procter & Gamble , which jumped 3 3\/8 to 127 .
41610	Along the way , investors dumped takeover stocks and shares of banks that have leveraged-buy-out debt and risky real estate loans on their books .

41624	But Texas Air , the owner of Continental and Eastern airlines , bucked the group 's decline by rising 7\/8 to 14 5\/8 in American Stock Exchange trading .
41627	Other blue-chip consumer issues also fared relatively well : PepsiCo rose 1 3\/8 to 58 1\/2 ; Coca-Cola Co. was unchanged at 66 3\/4 ; McDonald 's also closed unchanged at 30 1\/2 , and Merck rose 1\/2 to 75 1\/4 .

41720	Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year .
41721	A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase , or limit it to 25 % , would bring a major change in international economic policy , and could not be taken lightly .
41722	Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets .
41723	Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase , a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged .
41726	With the increase , even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate IMF-approved economic plans .
41729	The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose .
41730	If conservatives do n't support an increase in the IMF 's capital , then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative .
41732	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer .
41735	The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $ 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years .
41736	Also , he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $ 35,000 to a customer .
41737	Mr. Stein was fined $ 25,000 and suspended for three years .
41738	Messrs. Roberts and Stein could n't be reached for comment .
41739	The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement , neither man admitted , nor denied the alleged violations .
41740	Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade .
41742	The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom , which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators .
41743	Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office , and in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time Warner , charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business .
41744	HBO has close to 24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks , while Showtime and its sister service , The Movie Channel , have only about 10 million , according to Paul Kagan Associates , a Carmel , Calif. , research firm .
41746	But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO 's dominance of the pay TV business , and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor .
41747	`` It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace , '' Mr. Malone said in a statement .
41748	In a telephone interview , Robert Thomson , TCI senior vice president , said Showtime 's suit against HBO `` does n't involve us , and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that . ''
41755	Viacom also owns cable systems , but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems , with less than one million subscribers .
41756	The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom 's chief executive officer , Frank Biondi , and Winston H. Cox , president of the Showtime unit .
41757	`` This takes any question of Showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all , '' Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview .
41758	The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO , and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service .
41761	Boeing Co. , already struck by its Machinists union , briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands `` grossly excessive . ''
41763	A spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands , which included a 19 % pay hike in the first year and 8 % in the second and third years .
41764	The union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers .
41766	Meanwhile , a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists .
41771	Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases .
41772	It was n't clear , however , whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp. , a San Antonio , Texas-based data-processing systems maker .
41775	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Edelman said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13 , he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for $ 2.25 to $ 2.375 each .
41780	`` By encouraging massive , routine , voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups : those who carry the virus and those who do not , '' the Indianapolis research organization said in a new report .
41781	The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses .
41782	It warns that the AIDS epidemic `` may reduce the rate of growth of the work force , curb productivity gains and slow economic growth . ''
41784	But the report says : `` The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners , '' and testing is the only way to learn of infection .
41785	Hudson 's researchers estimated that it would cost less than $ 650 million a year to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old .
41786	In addition , the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive .
41787	An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday , but profit-taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts .
41790	It also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two hours later .
41791	The unit stabilized about midday New York time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen , prompting unconfirmed rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve had intervened to blunt the unit 's tumble .
41796	The August figure reflected a 6.4 % rise in imports and a 0.2 % drop in exports .
41798	He said that while the U.S. trade gap with Canada has widened significantly , the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues to narrow .
41801	In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8667 marks , down from 1.8685 marks late Monday , and at 142.75 yen , up from 141.85 yen late Monday .
41805	Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in Europe and Japan , several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $ 12 billion -- and a 190-point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange .
41807	The G-7 comprises West Germany , the U.S. , France , the U.K. , Italy , Canada and Japan .
41808	The so-called Louvre accord was seen to have set ranges of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks and 120 yen to 140 yen .
41809	They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U.S. banking system has been modest , and they do n't anticipate significant easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve .
41821	The products are so-called analog integrated circuits that have applications in the consumer electronics , automobile and electronic instrumentation markets .
41823	The electronics concern said it already has paid $ 2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor , Santa Clara , Calif. , and will pay the remaining $ 1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters .
41827	In the ratings compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co. , ABC , which broadcast the World Series , topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share .
41828	NBC was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by CBS Inc. 's television network with a 12.5 rating and 21 share .
41830	The first two games of the World Series between the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants did n't finish in the top 10 ; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place .
41832	NBC had five of the top 10 shows ; ABC had four and CBS had one .
41836	Houston-based Maryland Club Foods , which had sales of about $ 200 million last year , sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants , hotels , offices and airlines .
41837	The acquisition `` gives us additional production capacity for the food service coffee business and a stronger distribution network , '' a P&G spokesman said .
41838	P&G already sells its Folgers ground roast coffee to food service concerns , but not to as many markets as Maryland Club .
41839	For example , P&G up until now has n't sold coffee to airlines and does only limited business with hotels and large restaurant chains .
41840	Maryland Club also distributes tea , which fits well with P&G 's Tender Leaf brand , and hot cocoa products .
41841	The company said the acquisition has been completed and reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission .
41842	The purchase includes a coffee-roasting plant in Omaha , Neb. , and a leased facility in Houston .
41845	Funds will be used to repay existing short-term debt and to finance capital spending , it said .
41846	President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor , Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest , the White House said .
41848	But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president .
41849	White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success .
41851	But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the $ 156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 .
41852	Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape , incest and danger to the life of the mother .
41853	But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest , arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women .
41855	Media General Inc. intends to sell two of its West Coast weekly newspaper chains , Golden West Publishing Inc. and Highlander Publications , which together comprise 31 papers .
41856	Media General said it has had inquiries from potential buyers and expects to complete a sale in 1989 .
41860	Earlier this month , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , the country 's central bank , appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors .
41862	DFC is held 80 % by National Provident Fund , New Zealand 's largest pension fund , and 20 % by Salomon Brothers Inc. , the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of Salomon Inc. in New York .
41863	A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan , parent of the bank Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate .
41864	The managers said in a brief statement yesterday that Morgan will help evaluate DFC 's position and help determine alternatives .
41874	Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals , he added .
41875	One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies , but deteriorate nonetheless .
41882	The average interest rate fell to 8.292 % at Citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , from 8.483 % at last week 's sale .
41883	Bids totaling $ 465 million were submitted , and accepted bids were at 8.292 % .

41887	Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88 % , and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50 % rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin .
41888	The French electronics and defense group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs -LRB- $ 38.4 million -RRB- , compared with 130 million francs -LRB- $ 20.5 million -RRB- in the corresponding period of
41894	Rep. Lee Hamilton -LRB- D. , Ind . -RRB- said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan -LRB- D. , N.D . -RRB- are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy .
41895	Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget .
41896	The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence .
41897	Fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy .
41898	Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed . ''
41899	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
41902	Net fell to $ 40.1 million , or $ 1.50 a share , from $ 60.7 million , or $ 2.32 a share , a year earlier .
41904	Polyvinyl chloride capacity `` has overtaken demand and we are experiencing reduced profit margins as a result , '' said John D. Ong , chairman and chief executive .
41906	The plastic resin is used in a wide range of products , including siding , pipe and electrical wire insulation .
41912	However , the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded .
41915	In the interview , Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector , but `` in the long run , I do n't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars . ''
41916	Roberto Morelli , Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London , said that right now `` the market is n't being influenced by that kind of news , '' referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week .
41917	Paul Tanner was named president , chief executive officer and chairman of this oil and natural gas company .
41920	Mr. Boudreau will remain with Penn Pacific as a director and a member of the executive committee .
41925	Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company .
41937	Last week , many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran .
41940	Both Shearson 's Mr . Will and Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips & Drew , recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy .
41944	GM is expected to inject roughly # 200 million -LRB- $ 316 million -RRB- by acquiring some Jaguar shares , and then win Jaguar management 's promise of an eventual 30 % stake .
41947	Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early .
41950	U.S. takeover-stock speculators , who may own between 20 % and 30 % of Jaguar , could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal .
41953	He believes Jaguar 's share price could zoom to between # 8 and # 10 -LRB- $ 12.60 to $ 15.80 -RRB- .
41959	Clifford Stahl , president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc. , two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm 's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each , making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7\/8 in early May .
41966	Net income : $ 44.9 million ; or 25 cents a share
41968	Net loss : $ 1.7 million vs. net income : $ 21.2 million ; or 12 cents a share
41971	A.F. Sloan , 60 years old , announced that he will retire next April as chairman and chief executive officer of this snack food and bakery products maker .
41974	Newport Electronics Inc. of Santa Ana , Calif. , said Milton B. Hollander , who holds a 49.4 % stake , requested a special shareholders ' meeting next Wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate .
41977	The board is n't proposing a slate of its own and the other four current directors do n't want to serve beyond the special meeting date , Newport said .
41978	Mr. Hollander `` is the new owner and wants to exercise control , '' said Barret B. Weekes , Newport 's chairman .
41979	Sandoz AG , a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said that its group sales rose 25 % to 9.482 billion francs -LRB- $ 5.80 billion -RRB- in the first nine months of this year , with strong gains in all divisions .
41981	Positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period , although the company did n't provide figures , as is customary with Swiss companies .
41983	Amstrad PLC , a British maker of computer hardware and communications equipment , posted a 52 % plunge in pretax profit for the latest year .
41984	The # 76.6 million -LRB- $ 120.6 million -RRB- in pretax profit for the 12 months to June 30 was down from # 160 million -LRB- $ 252 million -RRB- a year earlier and below market expectations of # 80 million and # 90 million .
41985	The slump in profit , which came despite steady sales , was attributed to increased costs for parts and problems with model introductions .
41988	Microsoft Corp. 's earnings growth continued to outstrip that of most of its competitors and customers in the personal-computer industry , as it reported a 36 % jump in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 33 % revenue gain .
41989	The Redmond , Wash. company , a bellwether provider of operating systems and software for personal-computer makers and users , reported net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 of $ 49.6 million , or 87 cents a share , up from $ 36.6 million , or 65 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
41994	The stock had hit a high of $ 81 a share early last week but collapsed to $ 73.50 in the Friday stock plunge .
41996	But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing .
41997	As a result , Microsoft 's cost of goods , as a percentage of sales , fell 17 % from the year-ago quarter and 13 % from the previous period .
41999	Microsoft officials said the strong results also reflected continuing high demand for its software applications and operating systems .
42001	That segment continues to post strong quarter-to-quarter gains , while the low-end , or commodity segment , of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines .
42002	Compared with its previous quarter , the final period of its 1989 fiscal year , net rose 9 % , and sales rose 7 % .
42004	MIPS is a leader in what is known as reduced-instruction set computing , or RISC , a technology combining microprocessors and sophisticated software .
42006	Digital Equipment Corp. , Tandem Computers Inc. , NEC Corp. and Group Bull , among others , have similar arrangements with MIPs , based in Sunnyvale , Calif .
42009	Control Data also said it is developing what it called a `` supermainframe '' computer , the Cyber 2000 , intended for scientists , engineers and other users of generalpurpose high-performance computers .
42011	UAL has fallen $ 87.25 , or 31 % , in the three trading days since disclosure of the buy-out 's collapse jolted the stock market .
42012	Meanwhile , investor Marvin Davis said he remains interested in UAL , but he dropped his earlier $ 300-a-share back-up bid .
42013	Stock prices fell broadly in heavy trading , dominated by futures-related program selling and further declines by UAL and other airline stocks .
42020	An analyst cited weaker capital spending and exports .
42025	Bank of New England plans to sell some operations and lay off 4 % of its work force after a year of weak earnings and mounting loan problems .

42049	It has since asked holders not to immediately tender their shares under a recent $ 72-a-share , or $ 104 million , bid from AB SKF of Sweden , until McGill directors have completed their evaluation .
42050	In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , BroadBeach said it sold the 101,000 McGill shares for $ 7.3 million in a private transaction on Oct. 12 .
42051	BroadBeach did n't identify the buyer of the shares , but the date of the selloff followed by one day the Swedish concern 's tender offer , and the indicated price of the shares sold equals SKF 's $ 72-a-share tender offer price .
42052	A BroadBeach spokeswoman said the company sold the stock in the open market and thus could n't identify the buyer or buyers .
42054	Mr. Nogales , former president of United Press International and the Univision Spanish-language network , most recently co-founded Nogales Castro Partners , a California-based media acquisition firm .

42060	Oncor Inc. , Gaithersburg , Md. , said it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a genetic test that will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer .
42061	The B\/T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer , whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment , said Oncor President Stephen Turner .
42062	Mr. Turner said the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests , but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis .
42063	Mr. Turner said the test will be shipped in 45 days to hospitals and clinical laboratories .
42064	Dr. Wyndham Wilson , a cancer treatment specialist at the National Cancer Institute , said the test is widely used in research centers but is n't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment .
42065	But the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment , Dr. Wilson said .
42068	The company will charge $ 35 for a test and projects about $ 2 million in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing , he said .
42069	Unilab Corp. , Norcross , Ga. , said it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. in a cash and securities transaction valued at $ 85 million .

42076	Couch-potato jocks watching ABC 's `` Monday Night Football '' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays .
42079	Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities .
42080	Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost .
42081	But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned .
42082	`` We 've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people , '' says Mike Parks , president of Call Interactive , which supplied technology for both ABC Sports and NBC 's consumer minutes .
42084	One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive , a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co .
42086	Other long-distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool .
42087	Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television .
42089	For a while , high-cost pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial -LRB- and redial -RRB- movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses .
42092	From the fee , the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the originator , which must cover advertising and other costs .
42093	In recent months , the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume .
42094	Before , callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling one of two numbers .
42096	Now , callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want , and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds .
42097	Up to now , 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels .
42099	For several years , Turner Broadcasting System 's Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues -LRB- `` Should the U.S. military intervene in Panama ? '' -RRB- , but even the hottest controversies on CNN log only about 10,000 calls .
42101	Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger .
42102	The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call .
42103	Callers will be sent educational booklets , and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money .
42107	Profit from the calls goes to charity , but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking callers for voting , Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $ 19.95 , and 5 % of callers stay on the line to order it .
42109	Meanwhile , NBC Sports recently began `` Scores Plus , '' a year-round , 24-hour 900 line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news .
42112	Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic : On Mondays , Unilever N.V. 's Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a 30-second Lever Bros. commercial .
42114	If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers .
42116	She would n't say what the premium is , but it 's believed to be about 40 % above regular daytime rates .
42119	Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for `` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . ''
42121	This service identifies each caller 's phone number , and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists .
42123	`` For a piece on local heroes of World War II , we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal , '' he says .
42124	`` That 'll save us time and get people involved . ''
42130	`` A menu by phone could let you decide , ` I 'm interested in just the beginning of story No. 1 , and I want story No. 2 in depth , '' Mr. Monsky says .
42133	Integrated did n't identify the party or say why the talks failed .
42135	Integrated said that it would continue to pursue `` other alternatives '' to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- Integrated Resources Equity Corp. , Resources Trust Co. and Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp .
42138	The company did n't disclose the new estimate but said the change was related to Integrated 's failure to sell its core businesses , as well as `` other events , '' which it did n't detail , that occurred after its announcement last week that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective buyer .
42140	The unit is a loosely constructed group of about 3,900 independent brokers and financial planners who sell insurance , annuities , limited partnerships , mutual funds and other investments for Integrated and other firms .
42145	Integrated senior and junior creditors are owed a total of about $ 1.8 billion .
42147	The violent temblor , which lasted about 15 seconds and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale , also caused the collapse of a 30-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and shook Candlestick Park .
42148	The tremor was centered near Hollister , southeast of San Francisco , and was felt as far as 200 miles away .
42150	Some buildings collapsed , gas and water lines ruptured and fires raged .

42187	Alpine Group Inc. revised its exchange offer for $ 43.7 million face amount of 13.5 % senior subordinated debt due 1996 and extended the offer to Oct. 27 from Oct. 12 .
42188	The Hackensack , N.J. , company said holders would receive for each $ 1,000 face amount , $ 750 face amount of a new issue of secured senior subordinated notes , convertible into common stock at an initial rate of $ 6.50 a share , and 50 common shares .
42189	The new notes will bear interest at 5.5 % through July 31 , 1991 , and thereafter at 10 % .
42190	Under the original proposal , the maker of specialty coatings and a developer of information-display technologies offered $ 400 of notes due 1996 , 10 common shares and $ 175 in cash for each $ 1,000 face amount .
42196	The stock has fallen $ 87.25 , or 31 % , in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $ 300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever .
42198	Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis , who put United in play with a $ 5.4 billion bid two months ago , last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring UAL .
42200	Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid , British Airways , a 15 % partner in the buying group , indicated it wants to start from scratch .
42201	Its partners are United 's pilots , who were to own 75 % , and UAL management at 10 % .
42202	Adding insult to injury , United 's 25,000-member Machinists ' union , which helped scuttle financing for the first bid , yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign .
42204	John Peterpaul , Machinists union general vice president , attacked Mr. Wolf as `` greedy and irresponsible '' for pursuing the buy-out .
42205	Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope , UAL 's chief financial officer , stood to pocket $ 114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out , UAL executives planned to reinvest only $ 15 million in the new company .
42206	The blue-collar machinists , longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots , say the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances .
42209	Yesterday 's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks , which balked at the first bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around $ 250 a share , or $ 5.65 billion .
42210	Several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up .
42211	Citicorp , for example , said only that it had `` expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks , '' but did n't have an agreement .
42212	Late in the day , Mr. Wolf issued a onepage statement calling Mr. Peterpaul 's blast `` divisive and uncalled for . ''
42214	Meanwhile , in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent , it was learned that the UAL board held a telephone meeting Monday to hear an update on the situation , but that a formal board meeting is n't likely to be convened until early next week .
42219	But British Air , which was to have supplied $ 750 million out of $ 965 million in equity financing , apparently was n't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing .
42220	A group of United 's noncontract employees said in a statement , `` The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable . ''
42221	The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis , as well as in the response by UAL .
42223	In his statement , Mr. Wolf said , `` We continue to believe our approach is sound , and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same . ''
42229	At a meeting Sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid , the board also was informed by its investment adviser , First Boston Corp. , of interest expressed by buy-out funds including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Forstmann Little & Co. , as well as by Robert Bass , Morgan Stanley 's buy-out fund , and Pan Am Corp .
42230	The takeover-stock traders were hoping that Mr. Davis or one of the other interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray , or that the board might consider a recapitalization .
42233	The offering for the language school unit was announced by Robert Maxwell , chairman and chief executive officer of London-based Maxwell Communication Corp. , which owns Macmillan .

42241	Proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $ 80 million cash dividend to Macmillan and to lend the remainder of about $ 128 million to Maxwell Communications in connection with a promissory note .
42243	Berlitz , which is based in Princeton , N.J. , provides language instruction and translation services through more than 260 language centers in 25 countries .
42251	And , if still conscious at the evening 's end , you notice something else : The audience , at first entranced and hypnotized by the music , releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude .
42252	Currently in the middle of a four-week , 20-city tour as a solo pianist , Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers , equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone .
42253	He sits down at the piano and plays .
42255	Either one likes it or one does n't .
42258	Philip Glass is the emperor , and his music the new clothes , of the avant-garde .
42260	Softly introducing and explaining his pieces , Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital .
42261	The piano compositions , which have been labeled variously as minimalist , Oriental , repetitive , cyclical , monophonic and hypnotic , are relentlessly tonal -LRB- therefore unthreatening -RRB- , unvaryingly rhythmic -LRB- therefore soporific -RRB- , and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic -LRB- therefore both pretty and unconventional -RRB- .
42262	It is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task .
42266	Far from being minimalist , the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4\/4 time , octave intervals , and ragtime or gospel chord progressions .
42267	But the music has its charm , and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex .
42268	`` Opening '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- , from Glassworks , introduces the audience to the Glass technique : Never straying too far from the piano 's center , Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C , and his fingers seldom leave the keys .
42272	We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing .
42276	The chords modulate , but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys .
42278	`` The Fourth Knee Play , '' an interlude from `` Einstein on the Beach , '' is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in `` Three Blind Mice . ''
42279	When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand .
42281	You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment .
42282	In `` Mad Rush , '' which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length -LRB- Mr. Glass charmingly , and tellingly , confessed that `` this was no problem for me '' -RRB- , an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved .
42285	Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany , and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces .
42288	Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name .
42289	When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film .
42291	Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz 's sense that the 1974 `` Music in Twelve Parts '' is as encyclopedic and weighty as `` The Well-Tempered Clavier . ''
42293	Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky , the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler .
42294	Mr. Spiegelman is professor of English at Southern Methodist University and editor of the Southwest Review .
42298	Honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in Yamatake-Honeywell , but indicated it intends to hold at least 20 % of the joint venture 's stock long term .
42301	Yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was `` pleased with our progress '' in that regard and `` hopes to provide additional details soon . ''
42302	Honeywell said its Defense and Marine Systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter , resulting in lower operating profit for that business .
42303	Overall , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 74.4 million , or $ 1.73 a share , for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $ 41.4 million , or 98 cents a share , a year earlier .
42304	The previous period 's results included a $ 108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $ 12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales .
42306	For the nine months , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 212.1 million , or $ 4.92 a share , compared with earnings of $ 47.9 million , or $ 1.13 a share , a year earlier .
42309	In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , `` ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' -LRB- `` Congress's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 -RRB- .
42310	This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong .
42313	Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero discharge . ''
42315	This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute .
42316	Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water ; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors .
42318	National Geographic , the sixth-largest U.S. magazine , is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy , high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love .
42319	So why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10 % and ad revenue by 7.2 % in the first half ?
42321	Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women .
42323	But now , the magazine is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign .
42326	People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . ''
42329	The magazine had its best year yet in 1988 , when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17 % gain in ad pages , to 283 .
42331	The reason , ad executives say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market .
42333	When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all .
42334	Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , '' says Harry Glass , New York media manager for Bozell Inc .
42336	But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors .
42337	Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions , top management , and other groups .
42338	Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do .
42341	It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force .
42342	And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that .
42347	Ms. McCraw says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in 10 categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food .
42355	However , when negotiations bogged down recently , WCRS 's chief executive , Peter Scott , met in Paris with another French firm , Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit , or BDDP .
42356	According to the executive , BDDP 's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the WCRS-Eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today .
42359	NEW ACCOUNT : Procter & Gamble Co. , Cincinnati , awarded the ad accounts for its line of Professional Crisco vegetable shortening and oil products to Northlich , Stolley , LaWarre , Cincinnati .
42364	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges , a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders .
42365	The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites `` problems '' associated with the practice .
42366	Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers .
42367	The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
42369	Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders .
42371	The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand .
42374	The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them .
42375	Wendy Gramm , the agency 's chairman , told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving .
42377	Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis , the member said , `` does n't seem to have much economic impact . ''
42378	Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as socalled locals .
42379	`` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel .
42385	Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers .
42388	`` It 's too soon to tell ... but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it , '' he said .
42395	Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a Japanese style .
42396	Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside .
42402	Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements .
42403	Lee Seidman of Cleveland says Infiniti `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream .
42404	Mr. Seidman says he turned down a Lexus franchise in part because `` the building was gorgeous but very expensive . ''
42405	To head off arguments , Infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and low-interest construction loans .
42410	Blocked by patent protection from following suit , Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip .
42411	By 1979 , designers and engineers at Dictaphone , a Pitney Bowes subsidiary , had produced a working model of a `` picocassette '' recorder .
42413	Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project .
42416	Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 , but it has n't sold well .
42417	To date , says Emil Jachmann , a Dictaphone vice president , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . ''
42419	It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products .
42421	`` It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say ` unbelievable , ' '' says Mr. Jachmann .
42422	Dictaphone 's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the TRIAD Design Project , sponsored by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School .
42423	The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago 's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley .
42425	ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile , Ala. , was raking some sycamore leaves , but the rake kept riding up over the piles .
42426	The harder he tried to push them into large piles , the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back .
42427	So Mr. Barrett , then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association , took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up .
42429	Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake , the four-inch prongs , or `` wonderbars , '' also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves .
42432	Richard Mason , president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg , W. Va. , says the Barrett rake `` makes sense , '' but it would be `` tough '' to explain to consumers .
42435	Odds and Ends
42436	NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins , promises Geste Corp. of Goshen , Ind. , the designer of a bed support to replace traditional frames .
42438	Nearly half of U.S. consumers say they 'll pay up to 5 % more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable , according to a survey commissioned by the Michael Peters Group , a design consultant .
42443	During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , NavforJapan .
42444	Those obsolete operations cost less than $ 2 billion a year , and keep Mac 's ghost quiet .
42446	In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama .
42448	The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support .
42451	The brigade has n't been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case .
42453	We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such .
42454	The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it .
42455	You see , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him .
42457	To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it .
42458	But we still hear him moaning at night because the Navy has a few ships left , and to satisfy him the Navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois , its space operations to another command in Colorado , the frogmen to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort Bragg , and the Navy 's Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida .
42459	Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran .
42462	But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and people -- lots .
42463	So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force .
42464	But that ghost was n't fooled ; he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force -- even though it cost $ 8 billion or $ 10 billion a year .
42465	After Mr. Carter was defeated in 1980 , the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and Cap Weinberger .
42468	Why , he used to lay in wait for Cap ; suddenly he 'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap 's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $ 2 billion or so .
42469	Cap added four more divisions to the Army , two active and two reserve ; two carrier groups to the Navy ; a division -- equivalent to the Marines ; and the C-5B , KC-10 , C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force .
42470	He bought $ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and $ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new $ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean .
42472	One night both Marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground .
42473	Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command .
42474	He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean .
42476	They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers .
42477	But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains .
42478	Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ?
42480	Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
42483	But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf .
42487	But would n't you know , now that we are spending jillions of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject .
42489	Predictably , some Navy guys said : `` Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa ?
42490	Could n't we save $ 20 billion or $ 30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ?
42491	And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs , afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf ?
42495	Marshall came clanking in like Marley 's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots .
42497	So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that : He canceled the 600-ship Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates .
42498	Then he canceled production of the Navy 's most important carrier aircraft , the F-14 and the A-6 .
42500	Marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now , but he 'll be back .
42501	What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks .
42502	They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships .
42503	Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in the 1970s , and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people 's hair white .
42506	The metal and marble lobby of CenTrust Bank 's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan .
42508	At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive , David L. Paul .
42512	The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L 's new office tower , designed by I.M. Pei .
42517	The acquisitions , officials said in a letter to Mr. Paul , were `` unsafe , unsound and unauthorized . ''
42530	Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in $ 150 million by selling off 63 of CenTrust 's 71 branches , but it has yet to be approved by regulators .
42531	It is Mr. Paul 's art venture , however , that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators , not to mention galleries throughout the world .
42532	Embittered shareholders -LRB- some of whom are suing -RRB- say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&L crisis .
42534	Gallery directors , meanwhile , say Mr. Paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better .
42537	The great collectors we depended on , such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon , have stopped buying , and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting ... . ''
42538	Mr. Payson , an art dealer and collector , sold Vincent van Gogh 's `` Irises '' at a Sotheby 's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond .
42539	-LRB- Trouble is , Mr. Bond has yet to pay up , and until he does , Sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key . -RRB-
42541	He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby 's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York .
42547	Afterward , Mr. Paul is said by Mr. Guterman to have phoned Mr. Guterman , the New York developer selling the collection , and gloated .
42550	Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating .
42553	Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco .
42555	Nicholas Hall , the president of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo .
42557	People were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George Wachter . ''
42560	Sotheby 's , the auction house founded in London 1744 and now under the umbrella of Sotheby 's Holdings Inc. , was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business .
42566	`` An unknown quantity to most of the art world , Paul is no stranger to lavish spending , '' the magazine said , noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat .
42567	`` He recently bid $ 30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world 's great chefs , but the final party cost closer to $ 100,000 . ''
42570	In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters .
42572	The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book value of the collection -LCB- be -RCB- reduced to zero . ''
42574	The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : `` Govern yourself accordingly . ''
42575	The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the bank 's `` furniture and fixtures , '' were actually hanging in the chairman 's house .
42576	Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's .
42583	The $ 12 million lavished on the Rubens , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its provenance .
42588	Victor Wiener , the executive director of the Appraisers Association of America , agrees that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat .
42589	`` It 's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen . ''
42593	Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price , he says , were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out .
42596	Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales .
42598	-LRB- Impressionist and modern paintings , not tracked by Salomon , are ranked even higher at 74 % by Sotheby 's . -RRB-
42604	It 's not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum `` reserve '' prices set by the sellers .
42611	`` They went up 51 % last year , and they 'll do it again this year , '' he declares .
42615	And while Sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world , private art dealers , `` wo n't be happy to hear it , '' she adds , `` a number of -LCB- the artworks -RCB- have already been sold , and at a substantial profit . ''
42617	That is n't 51 % , and the claim is n't documented .
42618	He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on Sotheby 's or Mr. Wachter .
42619	Mr. Paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively .
42621	He says he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial Rubens -- `` carefully and prudently , just as it was put together . ''
42623	That is , he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works .
42626	People hold out and try to get a bargain . ''
42627	Sotheby 's defends itself and Mr. Paul in the matter .
42628	Mr. Wachter says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment .
42629	`` On occasion , he paid a high price , '' Mr. Wachter concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors .
42630	Naomi Bernhard Levinson , a fine-arts appraiser at Bernhard Associates in San Francisco , considers it `` definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased . ''
42633	`` Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be . ''
42634	Frequently , clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding , she adds , `` so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be . ''
42636	Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection .
42637	Because of the pressure on CenTrust to sell , dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices .
42638	But so far , Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding fast .
42640	`` I tried to steal the picture -- to buy it attractively -- and -LCB- Sotheby 's -RCB- would n't do it .
42642	Meanwhile , Mr. Paul and CenTrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence .
42643	Mr. Paul has been characterized as `` the Great Gatsby or something , '' complains Karen E. Brinkman , an executive vice president of CenTrust .
42647	But at just that moment , he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen .
42649	The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs , leatherbound books and , of course , a $ 12 million Rubens .
42653	`` Otherwise , the regulators will take it for decadence , and nowadays everything 's got to be pristine . ''
42654	Figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs .
42656	The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
42657	Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
42664	The new board 's seven-member structure kept four CPAs , but the others were from industry and academia .
42665	Francis M. Wheat , a former Securities and Exchange Commission member , headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March 30 , 1972 .
42666	The former board had produced `` 21 opinions and 1,000 critics '' in its 12-year life , its chairman had conceded .
42668	In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices .
42674	The FASB since then has issued 102 rules , and some still rile industry .
42676	Amcast Industrial Corp. said it plans to repurchase 500,000 shares , or about 7 % of its shares outstanding , in open market transactions .
42678	Amcast previously had said it planned to repurchase shares , but did n't disclose when or how many shares it intended to buy back .
42689	The price of the second simulator ranges between C$ 16.4 million and C$ 18 million , CAE said , depending on when the Army exercises its option .
42690	CAE is a Toronto-based maker of commercial and military aircraft simulators and training equipment .
42692	Total value of the contract could be $ 100 million , Helionetics said , and work on the project would be about evenly divided .
42694	This Los Angeles company and its Union Federal Savings Bank subsidiary said more than 99 % of their 7 1\/4 % convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 were tendered for conversion into UnionFed common stock .
42697	David D. Lung was appointed president and chief operating officer of this maker of building materials for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles .
42699	Mervin Lung remains chairman and chief executive officer .
42700	David Lung has been with Patrick since 1970 , and has served as vice president for administration and purchasing since 1987 .
42704	Reynolds Metals Co. said third-quarter net income dropped nearly 10 % to $ 123.7 million , or $ 2.10 a share , from $ 137.2 million , or $ 2.56 a share , a year earlier .
42708	The No. 1 domestic aluminum producer , Aluminum Co. of America , Friday said its earnings fell 3.2 % to $ 219 million , or $ 2.46 a share .
42709	And Alcan Aluminium Ltd. yesterday reported net income slid 30 % to $ 180 million , or 77 cents a share , from $ 258 million , or $ 1.07 a share .
42710	Analysts on average had been expecting about $ 2.70 for Alcoa and $ 1 for Alcan .
42714	Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's slowest period .
42715	But William O. Bourke , chairman and chief executive officer , said the ingot price `` appears to have bottomed out . ''
42716	He said shipments are continuing at a `` healthy '' pace and the company has no excess inventory .
42718	Nevertheless , the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs , including a new employee profit-sharing plan .
42720	No strikeout , but certainly no home run .
42721	That 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead , according to money managers and a few brokers .
42727	Mr. Neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings growth and the `` LBO sweepstakes '' -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks , such as media and airlines .
42730	`` This is not a grossly overvalued market , but it 's not cheap either , '' says George Collins , president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore .
42734	The common view , says Abby Cohen , strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , is that there will be `` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky-dory .
42739	He expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % , with the Dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 `` between now and June . ''
42740	After Friday 's decline , Mr. Perritt 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by Benjamin Graham , an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis .
42741	He found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued .
42743	`` I 've been two-thirds in cash since July , and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , '' he says .
42746	For instance , he says , International Business Machines and Unisys might look cheap , but investors might continue to do better with stocks like Walt Disney , Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola , strong performers in recent years .
42750	`` I still think we will have a 3000 Dow , whether it 's six months or 12 months from now I do n't know , '' says David Dreman , managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York .
42753	Yesterday , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks .
42754	Dean Witter now recommends 85 % , Goldman 65 % and Merrill Lynch 50 % .
42762	`` It was an overreaction to an event -LCB- the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL -RCB- that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . ''
42764	Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans .
42765	That hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks .
42768	She thinks the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months , then recover and go higher .
42769	Companies with steady earnings growth could do well , she says , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 % .
42770	The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains , investment bankers and retailers said .
42772	The chains include Bloomingdale 's , owned by Campeau Corp. , Toronto ; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's , owned by B.A.T Industries PLC , London ; and B. Altman & Co. and Sakowitz Inc. , owned by Hooker Corp. , which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator .
42774	The combination of so many chains available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing LBO 's as Miller & Rhoads Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices , retailing observers said .
42776	`` Investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either . ''
42777	Earlier this year , bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales , Mr. Rosenthal added .
42779	`` Competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue , '' added Mr. Rosenthal .
42788	Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation .
42792	However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt .
42794	`` What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain .
42796	Still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in tumult , in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau .
42799	Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management , or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past .
42802	The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law , rather than federal law .
42809	Despite continuing troubles with problem assets and nonperforming loans , the trust said it expects to be able to maintain or increase the rate of distributions because of operations of joint-venture properties .
42811	The court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use .
42812	FERC 's regulation had given pipelines until March 31 , 1989 , to pass on to customers as much as 50 % of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short .
42813	A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts .
42815	According to industry lawyers , the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism .
42817	The court , agreeing with pipeline companies , found the March 31 deadline was `` arbitrary and capricious '' and `` highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines '' that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline .
42819	The court ordered FERC to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation .
42821	The complex regulation , known in the industry as Order 500 , has been hotly contested by all sides , including natural-gas producers , pipelines , local distribution companies and consumers .
42822	The court 's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions , but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court .
42827	The mortgage and equity real estate investment trust last paid a dividend on Aug. 1 , 1988 , when holders received 75 cents a share .
42828	Despite continuing troubles with problem properties and nonperforming loans , the Dallas trust said it has rebuilt reserves , abandoned properties with little potential and experienced improved operating results from joint ventures .
42829	MLX Corp. said it reached a preliminary agreement with senior lenders to its refrigeration and air-conditioning group to restructure the $ 188.5 million of credit facilities the lenders provide to the group .
42830	MLX , which also makes aircraft and heavy-duty truck parts , said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of nine businesses that make up the group , the biggest portion of which was related to the 1986 purchase of a Hillman Co. unit .
42833	The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals .
42834	William P. Panny , MLX chairman and chief executive , said the pact `` will provide MLX with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the company 's capital structure . ''
42835	MLX has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering a proposed offering of $ 120 million in long-term senior subordinated notes and warrants .

42840	Flowers Industries Inc. said it will report a charge of eight cents to 10 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter , ended Sept. 23 , from the sale of two bakeries , in High Point , N.C. , and Gadsden , Ala .
42843	A year earlier , Flowers had fiscal first-quarter net income of $ 8 million , or 23 cents a share , on revenue of $ 170.4 million .

42851	Dun & Bradstreet Corp. 's Market Data Retrieval unit said it acquired School and College Construction Reports service from Intelligence for Education Inc .
42853	The service supplies weekly reports on school and college construction plans .
42854	Market Data Retrieval is a compiler of educational information and provides related services .
42855	Closely held Intelligence in Education , of Larchmont , N.Y. , is an educational publisher and consultant .
42857	The plans include a subway system , a congress center , floating trees , fanciful fountains -- and as many as 60,000 additional tourists a day .
42858	Expo enthusiasts argue that holding the fair would attract businesses , create jobs and help renovate abandoned sections of town .
42860	`` This city already has too many tourists , and it ca n't hold them all , '' says Pierluigi Beggiato , the president of the Venice hoteliers association .
42861	About 40 Italian businesses , including Fiat S.p . A. and Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. , have formed a consortium to lobby for holding the expo in Venice .
42863	The three establishments -- two in Warsaw and one in Krakow -- accept only foreign currency and are joint ventures between Polish firms and Western companies .
42866	But Bogdan Gumkowski , who runs the casino at Warsaw 's Marriott Hotel , said the ventures would help Poland service its $ 39 billion foreign debt by pouring dollars into the state firms in the joint ventures -- the LOT airline and Orbis tourist organization .
42867	Algeria plans to increase natural-gas sales to Europe and the U.S. .
42869	Algeria also wants to build a pipeline through Morocco and across the Strait of Gibraltar to supply Spain , France and West Germany with up to 15 billion cubic meters a year by the late 1990s .
42870	South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers agreed to suspend the strike by diamond workers and resume negotiations with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. over their wage dispute , De Beers said .
42875	The gathering is expected to focus on curbing the fouling of rivers and lakes , limiting damage from industrial accidents and improving the handling of harmful chemicals .
42876	West German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said Bonn is convinced of the need for cooperation , `` especially with our neighbors in the East , because we are directly affected by their ecological progress or lack of it . ''
42877	The U.S. and Canada joined every European country except Albania at the meeting .
42879	Editor Hasse Olsson said plans had called for 7,000 copies of the monthly Are Paev -LRB- Business Paper -RRB- to be sold at newsstands and an additional 3,000 promotion issues to be sent by direct mail .
42881	The Swedish publishing company Bonniers owns 51 % of Are Paev , and the Estonian management company Minor owns 49 % .
42886	The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25 % interest rates , or providing fresh loans .

42896	The company develops and markets products for the food service industry .
42899	Korean car exports have slid about 40 % so far this year , but auto makers here are n't panicking .
42902	In fact , some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the U.S. and Canada is a blessing ; otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market .
42905	Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- Hyundai , Kia Motors Corp. , Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co. -- plan to build more factories .
42908	But South Korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in Korea will stay strong .
42914	She and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend jaunts .
42916	The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity .
42920	The most popular style is the stretched `` Family , '' which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer .
42925	By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000 .
42926	Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat , but Kia , the scrappy No.3 auto maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit .
42930	At 3.8 million won , or $ 5,700 , the econobox is the lowest-priced car in South Korea .
42932	Ford Motor Co. and Japan 's Mazda Motor Corp. have equity interests in Kia .
42934	Loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible , with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won , or $ 120 .
42935	Daewoo Motor , a 50-50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. and the Daewoo Group conglomerate , is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting .
42936	Shipments of its Lemans to GM 's Pontiac division are off about 65 % from a year ago , versus a 44 % decline for Hyundai and an 18 % increase for Kia .
42940	In fact , a sister company , Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery , plans to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s .
42945	Robert P. Bulseco , 44 years old , was named president and chief administrative officer of this regional commercial bank .
42947	Robert Robie , 51 , was named to the new positions of vice chairman and chief credit officer .
42948	Many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday , but decided not to cash in their chips after all .
42949	As the stock market bounced back , withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday , when investors dumped $ 2.3 billion , or about 2 % of stock-fund assets .
42950	Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , said phone volume was more than double its typical level , but still half that of Oct. 19 , 1987 .
42951	Net outflows from Fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ 300 million , or below 15 % of the $ 2 billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios .
42955	And some investors at Fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day .
42956	`` Two years ago , there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone , '' said Kathryn McGrath , head of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
42969	As stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders .
42971	At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham , Mass. , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches .
42973	At Fidelity 's office in downtown Boston , Gerald Sherman walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund .
42977	Shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ 200 billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at Campeau Corp. and steadily declining prices .
42983	When the market stabilized , he added , the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back .
42991	SOFT CONTACT LENSES WON federal blessing on March 18 , 1971 , and quickly became eye openers for their makers .
42992	The Food and Drug Administration that day said Bausch & Lomb could start selling them in the U.S. .
42993	The cornflake-size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses , which had been around since 1939 .
43001	The product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving .
43005	Last month the FDA and Contact Lens Institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch .
43010	In the wake of Friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound , some companies are already postponing deals , and others wish they could .
43015	Earlier this month , Staples Inc. , a Newton , Mass. , office-supplies discounter , said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public .
43016	At the time , its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ 19 , and bankers believed Staples would sell new stock without a hitch .
43018	Business , however , continues to be `` robust , '' and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans , says Todd Krasnow , a senior executive .
43026	Officers of the company , a health-care concern , `` were very discouraged on Friday and felt they should n't go public ; we felt they should , '' says Sanford Robertson , partner in the banking concern .
43038	Debt-free and profitable , the Boulder , Colo. , computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an IPO now , he says .
43039	KnowledgeWare Inc. , an Atlanta computer-software concern , says it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO this week or next -- unless conditions change .
43046	In a sagging market , the Federal Reserve System `` might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest rates down , '' says Leonard T. Anctil , vice president of the Bank of New England , Boston .
43053	Alan Wells , president of Bollinger , Wells , Lett & Co. , a New York merger specialist , thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals .
43055	And William E. Wetzel Jr. , a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc. , says the market 's gyrations will underline the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments .
43057	Bay Financial Corp. , hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments , reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings .
43058	Bay said a `` substantial part '' of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made .
43060	Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments .
43062	The company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June 30 of $ 36.2 million , or $ 9.33 a share , on revenue of $ 13.1 million .
43063	A year earlier , the company had a loss of $ 10.8 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on revenue of $ 10.8 million .
43064	For the year , it had a net loss of $ 62 million , or $ 15.97 a share , on revenue of $ 44.3 million .
43065	In the previous year , it had a loss of $ 22.5 million , or $ 6.52 a share , on revenue of $ 41.1 million .
43068	A year earlier , fair-market value per share was $ 26.02 and book value was $ 9.43 a share .
43069	Annualized interest rates on certain investments as reported by the Federal Reserve Board on a weekly-average basis : 1989 and Wednesday October 4 , 1989 .
43071	TRW Inc. reported a 12 % decline in third-quarter net income , but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters , operating profit rose 16 % .
43072	The electronics , automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ 60 million , or 98 cents a share , down from $ 68 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier .
43074	Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units , partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems .
43077	The company said aerospace and defense sales were up 2 % for the quarter to $ 802 million , and operating profit climbed 6 % to $ 61 million , mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts .
43078	Automotive sales jumped 16 % to $ 791 million , mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems , TRW said .
43080	However , excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear , operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14 % , reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems .
43081	Materials and production costs also rose , TRW said .
43085	For the nine months , TRW 's net was $ 199 million , or $ 3.22 a share , down 3 % from $ 205 million , or $ 3.33 a share , a year earlier .
43088	In fact , Kazuo Ishiguro 's `` The Remains of the Day '' -LRB- Knopf , 245 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them .
43089	It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants .
43090	As the narrator Stevens , the solitary butler of Darlington Hall , mulls over such hallowed terms as `` greatness , '' `` dignity , '' `` service '' and `` loyalty , '' we see how pious cant subverts the soul .
43091	Stevens 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master 's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve .
43095	As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall , where a former housekeeper resides , perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage , perhaps -LRB- he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge -RRB- not disinclined to return to domestic service , Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait , a credo and the author 's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we 're reading :
43096	`` We call this land of ours Great Britain , and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice .
43098	It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart .
43100	It is as though the land knows of its own beauty , of its own greatness , and feels no need to shout it .
43101	In comparison , the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America , though undoubtedly very exciting , would , I am sure , strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness . ''
43107	He `` will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing ... .
43112	It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : `` For all its sad associations , whenever I recall that evening today , I find I do so with a large sense of triumph . ''
43113	We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow .
43114	That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent , but funny and sad and enlightening , is entirely the author 's triumph .
43115	Mr. Ishiguro 's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic , cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel , `` An Artist of the Floating World , '' set in Japan after the war .
43116	Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years , he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster .
43117	With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and -LRB- utterly repressed -RRB- sexual love , but British anti-Semitism , the gentry 's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler , and the moral problematics of loyalty : `` It is , in practice , simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service ... .
43118	` This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable .
43121	In the end , after meeting with the former housekeeper , Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk , thinking of her and of his employer , and declares `` I trusted .
43130	Mr. Locke teaches English and comparative literature at Columbia University .
43131	UGI Corp. said its AmeriGas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in Waukesha , Wis. , to AGA Gas Inc. , Cleveland .
43133	The transaction is part of UGI 's continuing program to shed AmeriGas 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's propane business .
43134	Since June , AmeriGas has netted more than $ 100 million from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than $ 50 million to acquire three propane distributors .
43135	UGI is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its AmeriGas subsidiary .
43139	Then Aer Lingus , the Irish flag carrier , could teach Aeroflot pilots to fly the Boeings , and the fleet could be based here at Shannon Airport .
43146	The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport .
43147	GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s .
43148	Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities .
43151	And as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit .
43152	`` Irish and Soviet people are similar , '' says Mr. Ovcharenko .
43155	Moreover , he says , Irish companies are small but spunky .
43159	Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year , and Shannon Airport , the airline 's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union , saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through .
43160	An apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants .
43163	What Aeroflot does n't pour into its own gas-guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority , which resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France , Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines .
43164	Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees , ground-handling and catering bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency .
43168	Duty-free shops in Leningrad 's Pulkova Airport opened in July , and hard-currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon .
43169	Aer Rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in Sochi , a Black Sea resort , and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the Georgian city of Tbilisi .
43170	Aeroflot 's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport .
43171	Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets , tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana , Kingston and Mexico City .
43174	A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey .
43178	Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets , but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that ca n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop .
43182	And , with those contacts in place , it could be relatively simple to add Aer Lingus and GPA to the team .
43184	Britain 's industrial production rose 1.5 % in August from July and was up 0.9 % from August 1988 , according to provisional data from the Central Statistical Office .
43185	Output in the energy sector , which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market , rose 3.8 % in August from May but was down 7.1 % from a year earlier .
43186	The latest figures compare with July 's 4.5 % month-to-month rise and 11.3 % year-to-year fall .
43190	`` We 've had the Russians and Chinese , and people from India visiting us , '' Mr. Iverson beams .
43193	Already , USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor 's technology to see if they can adopt it .
43196	New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller , less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago .
43197	It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market -- the major steelmakers ' largest , most prized , and until now , untouchable , market .
43199	Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting , which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces .
43200	Those massive structures , while posing cost and environmental headaches , effectively locked out all but deep-pocketed giants from steelmaking .
43201	`` There 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel , '' says William Dennis , vice president , manufacturing and technology , for the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute .
43204	Moreover , their balance sheets are rich with diversity , their old plants shuttered , and work forces lean .
43208	He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence .
43210	And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening , hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity -- the industry 's Darth Vadar .
43212	`` They 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible . ''
43213	No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers , who remain the undisputed kings of highest-quality steel used for autos and refrigerators .
43214	Nucor 's plant in Crawfordsville , Ind. , ultimately will produce only one million tons annually , a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket , and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high-profit market .
43215	Still , flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter , representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year .
43219	`` At this point , the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market , but it does challenge them to develop new markets , '' says James McCall , vice president , materials , at Battelle , a technology and management-research giant based in Columbus , Ohio .
43221	In the past , says Armco 's chief economist John Corey , steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock .
43222	`` We said : ` We 've got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , ' '' he says , adding : `` Now we 're figuring out what people need , and are going back to make it . ''
43223	Armco 's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp. 's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City , Mo. , two or three days a week .
43225	Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers .
43226	For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled .
43230	Weirton Steel Corp. , Weirton , W. Va. , for example , is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors , with leaded glass inserts , as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones .
43235	Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of minimills .
43236	Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines , used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors .
43238	`` It 's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat , '' says John Jacobson , an analyst with AUS Consultants .
43240	Although he does n't expect any bankruptcies , he does see more plants being sold or closed .
43242	`` Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills . ''
43244	Japanese and European steelmakers , which have led the recent technology developments , are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992 .
43245	Moreover , the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries .
43247	`` People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business , '' says Mr. Iverson .
43252	After 78 days of mind-numbing testimony in federal court in Boston , the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys .
43253	Most have read the pre-trial documents , however , and estimate Kodak will be ordered to pay $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion for infringing on seven Polaroid patents .
43254	That may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the $ 12 billion Polaroid seeks .
43259	You might find something , but the chances are low , '' said Michael Ellman , an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co .
43260	And Eugene Glazer , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a -LRB- prediction -RRB- of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot .
43262	The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was `` willful and deliberate . ''
43264	Two analysts who have read the transcripts , David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Calvert D. Crary , a litigation analyst at Labe , Simpson & Co. , think Judge A. David Mazzone will decide in Kodak 's favor on the `` willful and deliberate '' issue .
43266	`` Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions , '' and Kodak followed his advice in every instance , Mr. Crary said .
43269	Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages , which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method .
43270	Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak had n't entered the market .
43273	Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan .
43279	IBM , which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term .
43280	In addition , IBM noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars .
43281	Earnings fell to $ 877 million , or $ 1.51 a share , somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ 1.60 a share .
43282	That compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion , or $ 2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute .
43286	The company said in a statement that `` demand for IBM products and services continues to be good world-wide .
43290	Jay Stevens of Dean Witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ 9 from $ 9.50 for 1989 and to $ 9.50 from $ 10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected .
43291	Both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $ 5.81 billion , or $ 9.80 a share , which itself was well below the record IBM set in 1984 .
43295	Analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter .
43296	`` A key part of the question is , how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up ? '' said Steve Cohen at SoundView Financial Group .
43301	He said IBM has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases .
43304	But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old , which means it is long in the tooth , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own .
43305	IBM is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market , and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year .
43306	But it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days , and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely on for much growth .
43308	But the AS\/400 , IBM 's highly successful minicomputer line , is losing its momentum , and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter .
43309	In addition , IBM 's growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8 % , well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from Fujitsu and the stronger dollar .
43311	In the nine months , IBM earned $ 3.17 billion , or $ 5.43 a share , down 8.4 % from the year-earlier $ 3.46 billion , or $ 5.83 a share .
43319	Results for 1989 will include about 40 cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions .
43322	Domestic soft-drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen only 1 % in the third quarter -- well below the 4 % to 5 % growth of recent years -- but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry .
43323	Mr. Calloway blamed the slower volume on rainier weather , a dearth of new products in the industry and -- to a much lesser extent -- pricing .
43328	Excluding the British snack-food business acquired in July , snack-food international tonnage jumped 40 % , with sales strong in Spain , Mexico and Brazil .
43330	Led by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell , restaurant earnings increased about 25 % in the third quarter on a 22 % sales increase .
43333	Same store-sales for Kentucky Fried Chicken , which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products , rose only 1 % .
43336	After a four-year , $ 7.7 billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company , soda bottlers , a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to Pepsi , Mr. Calloway said he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so .
43340	The White House said Ms. Hesse , a Chicago businesswoman who previously held posts at the Energy Department and FERC , is leaving to become a vice president of First Chicago Corp .
43342	He met Mr. Bush in the 1950s , when the president was a young oil man in Midland and Mr. Allday was a lawyer for an oil firm .
43351	Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities .
43354	Under the contract Hydro-Quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine Power starting in 1992 , 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in
43359	Central Maine said it is evaluating `` many energy options '' to make up for the lost future power , including new energy generation and management proposals from New England , and possibly new Canadian purchases .
43361	While Monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses , many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses , traders here and in New York said .
43362	Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based .
43366	An options contract gives the holder the right to buy -LRB- call -RRB- or sell -LRB- put -RRB- a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based on a predetermined price within a given time period .
43367	Options traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling .
43373	Exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed .
43377	Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday .
43379	`` Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money , '' Mr. Rawls said .
43380	`` A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm . ''
43381	The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend , with officials from the Federal Reserve Board , Securities and Exchange Commission , Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges .
43385	Yesterday 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials to conclude that the $ 50 million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by First Options .
43386	The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well , Mr. Rawls said .
43387	A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies .
43389	Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets .
43390	`` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer .
43392	But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee , the CBOE put up $ 8 million , the Amex added $ 4 million and $ 18 million came from Mr. Fossett 's own assets .
43394	Debora Foster takes off her necklace , settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward .
43395	With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background , the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster 's neck and shoulders .
43398	There , amid oil paintings and marble tables , massages are administered every Wednesday .
43405	The massages last 15 minutes and typically cost about $ 10 .
43409	Massage advocates say that kneading the head , shoulders , neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale .
43410	They also insist that touching is a basic need , as powerful as the need for food or sleep , and that the office is as good a place as any to do it .
43411	`` The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck , '' says Minnie Morey , an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in Grand Rapids , Mich. , where massages began last month .
43417	`` Sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear ` oohs ' and ` ahs ' coming out of the room , '' explains Morgan Banks , the agency 's health specialist .
43418	`` And you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing ` oohs ' and ` ahs . ' ''
43419	Last month , the complaints intensified and the massages ended .
43422	Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves `` bodyworkers '' and describing their office visits as `` reinvigoration breaks . ''
43423	But massage , no matter how chaste , is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution , and that makes some executives nervous .
43424	Last year , the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Co. , the large wood-products concern , invited a masseuse to its Tacoma , Wash. , offices .
43427	But after about eight months , the vice president of the division , Ed Soule , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt .
43429	`` In my view , -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around , '' he says .
43431	Russell Borner of Park Ridge , N.J. , says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company 's executives .
43432	He visits the same department every two or three weeks .
43433	His massage chair is kept in a closet , and a secretary escorts him past security .
43439	Elisa Byler , a St. Louis masseuse , won over officials at Emerson Electric Co. , a maker of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage .
43441	`` I pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate , '' says Ms. Byler , who has been visiting Emerson since January .
43445	`` The culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for an hour for $ 45 , '' he says .
43446	`` The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated .
43448	Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer 's chairs , which cost $ 425 and have since been copied by others , is a bit like straddling a recliner .
43449	Customers lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair .
43451	Mr. Palmer , who serves as president of the On-Site Massage Association and writes an industry newsletter , says some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace , as well as on street corners , in airports and malls , and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found .
43453	Three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red .
43457	`` But he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there were still six people in line waiting for a massage .
43458	The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her .
43459	But it 's like falling off a horse and getting back on . ''
43466	But several weeks ago , in the wake of the Beijing killings , the loan was canceled , according to bankers and executives close to the project .
43467	Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the move .
43468	Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4 , but the harsh crackdown , which caused many businesses to reassess their China transactions , `` gave the banks the out they wanted , '' says an official close to the Shanghai venture .
43470	While some commercial lending has resumed , international lenders remain nervous about China 's economic troubles and foreign debt -- $ 40 billion at the end of 1988 .
43473	The canceled Shanghai loan leaves Asia Development , a small concern , saddled with a half-completed 32-story apartment building and heavy debts .
43474	The company owes $ 11 million to the Shui On Group , the project 's Hong Kong contractor , and a significant , though unspecified , amount in legal fees to Coudert Brothers , a U.S. law firm , the sources say .
43480	But in a letter sent in August to Asia Development , Schroders said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management committee on time , according to officials close to the project .
43483	The bank syndicate is made up mostly of European banks , but it includes China 's state-owned Citic Industrial Bank .
43485	K mart Corp. agreed to acquire Pace Membership Warehouse Inc. for $ 23 a share , or $ 322 million , in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse-club business .
43486	The proposed merger comes as K mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal-Mart Stores Inc .
43489	Warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products , which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no-frills stores .
43492	But the Makro chain , which operates as a joint venture between K mart and SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands , has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ 300 million .
43495	In the year ended Jan. 31 , Pace rang up profit of $ 9.4 million , or 72 cents a share , after a tax-loss carry-forward , on sales of $ 1.3 billion , and analysts expect its results to continue to improve .
43496	`` The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability , '' said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. , who had been forecasting a 46 % jump in Pace 's net income from operations this year and another 42 % increase next year .
43506	For instance , K mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores , called hypermarkets , and warehouse-type stores specializing in office products and sporting goods .
43507	It also operates Waldenbooks , Pay Less Drug Stores and Builders Square home improvement stores .
43515	He will succeed Joel Chaseman , who will remain a vice president of the company and continue to represent Post-Newsweek stations in several industry organizations , the company said .
43524	The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct , Quotron said , but the average was wrong .
43526	At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm , a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked , `` What 's going on ?
43527	Is the market up or down ? ''
43534	A spokesman cited a `` technical error '' and declined to elaborate .
43537	`` It was a case of human error , which we found almost immediately and corrected , '' a spokesman for Reuter in New York said .
43538	Meanwhile , some currency traders at West German banks in Frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices .
43540	Dillon Read 's Ms. Stark said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification , and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen .
43550	He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures .
43556	So does Mr. Friend and his law partner , Nick Nichols .
43561	When Ms. Parks and her mother heard about what had happened , Mr. Friend says , they volunteered that they would like to give Mr. Alexander a good walloping .
43562	Mr. Friend says he passed that along to his adversary , and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which Derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander .
43563	Although time and place have yet to be determined , some details are in place .
43565	Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to `` catch him unawares from behind , '' he says .
43566	Mr. Alexander , for his part , insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else , ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start .
43578	Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago .
43581	Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
43583	But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher .
43584	The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour , moving several index points higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back .
43586	`` Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , '' said one S&P 500 broker .
43587	`` You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , '' he marveled .
43588	Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , were also large buyers , traders said .
43592	`` With the FBI around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , '' said one trader , referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade .
43596	On Friday , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues .
43597	`` Nothing traded on Friday , and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened '' yesterday , said Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co .
43601	But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday , he said , `` You could n't buy -LCB- junk bonds -RCB- and you could n't give them away . ''
43602	Yesterday 's rally was led by RJR Holdings 13 3\/4 % bonds , which initially tumbled three points , or $ 30 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 96 1\/4 before rebounding to 99 3\/4 .
43603	Bonds issued by Kroger , Duracell , Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday .
43604	But traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year .
43608	Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , `` We 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 . ''
43611	`` There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good . ''
43613	Almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV , Gillette Holdings -LRB- not related to Gillette Co. -RRB- , Interco , Seaman Furniture , Allied Stores , Federated Department Stores , National Gypsum , M.D.C. Holdings , Micropolis , Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications .
43618	Many issues `` bounced off the floor , '' Mr. Minella said , and benchmark junk issues `` recovered all of their losses '' from Friday and early yesterday .
43619	In contrast , he says , `` The stock market gained back only about half what it lost Friday , and the -LCB- government -RCB- bond market lost about half what it gained Friday . ''
43628	Whipsawed financially and emotionally by Friday 's heartstopping 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday 's 88-point rebound , they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market .
43629	The answer , say academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an investor .
43630	But , they say , people should n't try to be traders , who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock .
43632	`` If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the Great Depression and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , '' says Barry Berlin , vice president at First Wachovia Capital Management .
43634	But a dollar invested in long-term bonds in 1926 would have grown to only $ 16.56 , and a dollar put in Treasury bills would equal a meager $ 9.29 .
43637	For instance , Ken Gregory , a San Francisco money manager , calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , the chance of losing money is 3 % to 4 % over a 10-year period , compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year .
43640	Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says .
43643	People also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses .
43646	He says individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such as high-quality bonds .
43649	`` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros . ''
43650	Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market .
43651	The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but 2 % of the order 's value is an average , says Stephen Boesel , manager of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income mutual fund .
43655	`` It 's very tough for most individuals to out-trade the mutual funds or the market , '' says Mr. Lipper .
43657	Then , too , many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market .
43659	`` Unless an individual has a minimum of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker , '' says Mr. Lipper .
43669	Friday 's correction presents `` a pretty good buying opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , '' says Carmine Grigoli , chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp .
43672	In this method , a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down .
43674	`` When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you 're buying fewer shares , '' he says .
43675	Otherwise , if you put all your money in at one time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait three years to get even , Mr. Gregory says .
43679	Compound annual returns , including price changes and income from interest and dividends
43682	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission : Gehl Co. , initial public offering of two million shares of common stock , of which 1,450,635 shares are being offered by the company and 549,365 shares by holders , via Blunt , Ellis & Loewi Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co .
43683	Giant Industries Inc. , initial public offering of 3,111,000 common shares , of which 2,425,000 will be sold by the company , and the rest by holders , via Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Hanifen , Imhoff Inc .
43685	Jason Overseas Ltd. , initial offering of four million common shares , of which 3.2 million will be sold in the U.S. , and the balance outside the U.S. , via Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. and Mabon , Nugent & Co .
43687	Separately , bankers representing the group trying to buy United 's parent UAL Corp. met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price , possibly around $ 250 a share , or $ 5.65 billion .
43690	He said he might now sell his AMR stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price .
43692	News about UAL and AMR , whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the UAL announcement , sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
43693	UAL tumbled $ 56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares , and AMR declined by $ 22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands .
43694	Together , the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders , and caused a 7.3 % drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19 , 1987 .
43699	`` He 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it .
43703	AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees , a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass , or both .
43706	`` I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday , '' Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress .
43707	AMR declined to comment , and Mr. Trump did n't respond to requests for interviews .
43710	Between then and his bid on Oct. 5 , the price fluctuated between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375 .
43713	Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a share , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 .
43714	Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees .
43715	However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .
43717	Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co. said Mr. Trump `` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle .
43724	Meanwhile , Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out , met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price .
43725	Officials familiar with the talks said Citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ 250 a share , but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made .
43727	The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase could n't raise $ 7.2 billion .
43728	Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $ 3 billion , and said they were `` highly confident '' of raising another $ 4.2 billion .
43729	Together , Citicorp and Chase received $ 8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing .
43730	But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them .
43731	Officials familiar with the bank talks said the UAL buy-out group -- UAL pilots , management , and British Airways PLC -- is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest , but is n't likely to boost its $ 965 million equity contribution .
43737	In addition , the coalition of labor and management , longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis 's bid , could break apart now .
43741	But if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives , it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one .
43742	The pilots could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes .
43744	Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders .
43745	That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder .
43746	Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
43747	The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
43749	`` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
43754	That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .
43756	The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .
43761	Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .
43762	But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .
43763	`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
43765	The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
43767	Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
43771	PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
43772	Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
43774	It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
43776	The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
43781	A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
43786	Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
43790	In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
43798	`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
43799	`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''
43801	With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .
43802	At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .
43816	Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold .
43817	John Verret , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .
43822	The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two-year Business Week initiative on education .
43825	It 's what 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson ; 2 -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes .
43826	Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
43827	The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .
43831	So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .
43832	`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked .
43833	On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .
43835	The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision .
43837	That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .
43838	The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
43844	One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .
43845	Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
43846	A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
43847	`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
43850	The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
43851	I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
43852	Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .
43854	In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .
43855	He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .
43859	He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .
43861	The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .
43862	They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs .
43863	They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .
43875	The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results .
43876	NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
43879	In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
43881	In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
43884	Last year , NCR had net income of $ 439.3 million , or $ 5.33 a share , on $ 5.99 billion in revenue .
43885	For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million , or $ 3.40 a share , from $ 289.7 million , or $ 3.49 a share .
43890	Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?
43891	That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
43894	Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting .
43895	At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home .
43898	People are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ''
43907	Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .
43910	Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % .
43911	`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office .
43915	Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers .
43919	On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
43921	He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
43922	The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers .
43923	But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .
43927	By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break .
43937	`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % .
43939	As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open .
43940	In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes .
43942	As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K .
43943	Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar .
43951	As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it .
43952	The London index closed at 2163.4 , its high for the day , off 70.5 , or about 3.3 % .
43957	The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .
43958	The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .
43959	The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .
43960	The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .
43961	In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
43965	Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
43966	But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
43967	Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .
43968	`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide .
43970	Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit .
43971	Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
43973	It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
43974	The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
43976	All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .
43977	But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .
43978	One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies .
43979	In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
43980	`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations .
43981	`` We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said .
43984	Now in its 13th day , the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners .
43987	Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines .
43993	DPC , a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc. , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ' board .
43994	DPC holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable .
43997	Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .
43998	The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary .
44000	Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . ''
44001	He called today 's announcement `` opportunistic and disruptive '' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
44002	Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout .
44005	In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % .
44007	There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based on fundamentals .
44008	The economy of West Germany and the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- is highly stable . ''
44010	Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm .
44018	Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake .
44025	Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices .
44028	Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting .
44031	A 16.3 % drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy .
44037	It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group , Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that spearheaded the rally .
44038	Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York 's performance , they scooped up equities across the board .
44046	Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day .
44048	J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % .
44051	The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .
44053	In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ 233.6 million , or $ 1.25 a share .
44055	Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. Salem said .
44059	Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .
44061	Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
44066	The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ 143.6 million , or $ 1.45 a share , from $ 58.9 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
44067	The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
44069	In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million , or 1.13 % in the second quarter .
44070	Nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter .
44078	NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise .
44079	Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million .
44080	In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a share , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier .
44082	Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
44083	Net rose to $ 185.1 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 167.9 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year earlier .
44084	The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .
44088	The earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity .
44092	Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before .
44095	For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million , or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 469.4 million , or $ 4.13 a share , a year earlier .
44096	LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer .
44097	The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
44099	LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .
44100	BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted . ''
44102	McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said .
44103	The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years . ''
44106	In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares , or about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 is too low . ''
44109	Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an $ 18-a-share , or $ 576 million , tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns 67 % of Telerate .
44111	The group includes Putnam Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston ; Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco ; the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. , and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore .
44113	A spokesman for Dow Jones said he had n't seen the group 's filing , but added , `` obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions .
44114	Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ 18 a share .
44115	U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord .
44116	Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
44117	If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
44118	However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries . ''
44119	Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ''
44125	Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules .
44134	BancOklahoma Corp. said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , creditor banks and subordinated debenture holders .
44135	The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and debenture obligations through exchanges of cash and equity .
44138	In exchange for the $ 76 million they are owed , creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers , the bank holding company said .
44139	Also under the agreement , debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $ 7.7 million in debentures and holders of BancOklahoma 's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own , the company said .
44142	BSN Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $ 16.6 million in 7 3\/4 % convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants .
44143	Under terms of the offer , the sporting goods maker will swap $ 9 face amount of 9 1\/4 % subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share .
44146	BSN also is offering $ 850 face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $ 1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding .
44148	The offer is n't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged .
44149	BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value .
44150	If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer , BSN will increase its debt by $ 9 million , but it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt , said Michael J. Blumenfeld , president .
44153	Merrill Lynch & Co. 's net income dropped 37 % , while Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 7.5 % gain in net , and PaineWebber Group Inc. 's profit fell , but would have risen without a special gain a year ago .
44154	At Merrill Lynch , third-period net was $ 41 million , or 34 cents a share , down from $ 65.6 million , or 58 cents a share , a year ago .
44157	Investment banking revenue fell 22 % to $ 296.6 million on fewer equity and municipal underwritings .
44158	Merrill Lynch 's commission revenue grew 21 % , however , to $ 462.8 million , on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds .
44159	Revenue derived from interest and dividends jumped 30 % to $ 1.4 billion .
44161	The brokerage also reported a loss of $ 2.2 million from the discontinued operations and disposal of its Fine Homes International Limited Partnership real-estate subsidiary .
44162	Bear Stearns said net in the first quarter ended Sept. 29 reached $ 22.1 million , or 23 cents a share , from $ 20.5 million , or 20 cents a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
44166	Bear Stearns is the holding company for Bear , Stearns & Co. , the investment banking and brokerage firm .
44168	Separately , PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of $ 16.8 million , or 41 cents a share , reflecting a `` broad-based improvement '' in the company 's core businesses .
44169	Retail profit surged , but the company said it was only a `` modest contributor '' to third-quarter results .
44170	A year ago , net at the New York investment banking firm was $ 20.9 million , or 50 cents a share , including a special pretax gain of $ 46.3 million from the sale of the company 's interest in National Car Rental Systems Inc .
44174	Purchase of the 76-story structure is subject to execution of a definitive agreement , approval by the boards of Seafirst and its parent company BankAmerica Corp. , and approval by regulators .
44176	Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans .
44180	Added another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- , but it 's been very quiet .
44183	No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
44184	But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
44187	The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
44190	But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
44192	The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .
44197	Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
44198	At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
44200	At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange .
44201	It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively .
44202	Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
44204	To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
44205	Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .
44206	It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .
44207	Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline .
44209	The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .
44210	The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
44211	Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .
44214	Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions .
44216	Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB-
44219	A UNIFIED EUROPE poses labor problems and prospects for U.S. firms .
44222	FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also wo n't like plant relocations and needed restructuring , which means layoffs .
44223	Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as Spain and Italy , where wages are low and unions are weaker ; demand for trained labor and managers will rise there , FMC says .
44224	Pfizer , Fluor and GE see big `` EC 92 '' pluses : a push for job training and ease in moving and finding workers .
44231	The fan said he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat .
44232	The judge dismissed the fan 's suit against the team , however , ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring , and not responsible for a fight that was outside the players ' employment .
44235	It also recommends better retirement and day-care benefits , and basing pay on education , experience and nurses ' demanding work schedules .
44237	Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a `` clinical ladder , '' basing advancement on performance and education .
44238	Many also use recruiting bonuses , tuition reimbursement , loan repayment or child-care help .
44240	MRA Staffing Systems signs up nurses for paid travel , promising annual income up to $ 50,000 and free or subsidized housing .
44243	Fully 80 % of employees who say their bosses treat them with respect , but only a third of those who do n't feel respected say they 're satisfied with where they work .
44244	SPRUCING UP THE DIGS : About 200 employees of the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development for four months painted walls , polished and carpeted floors , bought plants , cleaned windows and blinds , and hung pictures at the agency 's Baltimore office .
44247	Despite labor-shortage warnings , 80 % aim for first-year wage increases of under 4 % ; and 77 % say they 'd try to replace workers , if struck , or would consider it .
44248	TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations , the National Association of Temporary Services says ; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82 % with more than a high-school education , and 31 % with college degrees .
44250	HOME-SALE LOSSES rise , but they 're often covered by employers .
44253	About 72 % reimburse for all or some losses .
44256	Goodrich wo n't ensure loss coverage , but will prevent a `` catastrophic loss '' ; it has given some employees the full purchase price when values fell from concern over dangers posed by a disposal site .
44257	Federal Express , Dow Chemical , Ford and National City Corp. will buy the home or let the worker sell to an outside firm , but usually wo n't cover a loss .
44262	When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone .
44263	They said the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could n't have performed better .
44268	The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day .
44274	Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food , home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y .
44276	Church 's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc. , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations .
44277	Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald 's Corp. , which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken .
44278	New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd .
44281	But some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first .
44283	He says the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities .
44284	The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency .

44303	Big Bear Supermarkets Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment .
44304	The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy 's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners .
44306	For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list .

44323	Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general , Bush administration officials said .
44324	If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate , Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop , who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues .
44325	Dr. Novello , an expert on pediatric kidney diseases , is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
44327	Dr. Novello 's office said she would n't talk with reporters , and it refused to release any information about her .
44328	The newsletter Medicine & Health , which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan , said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine .
44331	Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''
44340	It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures .
44342	The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .
44343	It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless .
44344	Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen .
44346	Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .
44347	More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink .
44349	The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .
44352	It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people .
44353	But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .
44356	The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . ''
44360	The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
44361	More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .
44366	According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 .
44369	Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
44370	French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
44378	Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .
44379	Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax .
44389	The multibillion-dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and\/or issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated .
44391	The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .
44392	Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .
44393	As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times .
44394	These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in .
44395	Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday .
44396	If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?
44400	To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .
44401	The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .
44402	The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
44403	If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions .
44404	Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .
44406	The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily .
44407	If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .
44408	If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .
44411	Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .
44412	Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .
44413	Mr. Jarrell , former top economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission , teaches at the University of Rochester 's Simon Business School .
44415	The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .
44419	Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York .
44420	Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash .
44423	Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U.S. or European equities .
44424	`` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co .
44425	`` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''
44426	The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that .
44428	At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8 % .
44429	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66 , or 1.7 % , to 2600.88 .
44434	A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low .
44436	The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 .
44438	Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .
44440	On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .
44449	He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
44451	`` Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''
44455	Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % .
44456	Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .
44457	Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses .
44458	Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market .
44460	`` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . ''
44461	Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
44462	Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China .
44469	Richard Chenevix-Trench , a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
44473	Nestor Hinzack , an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett , Buckeridge & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` sheep-like '' as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price .
44474	London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2 % .
44479	The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points , or 12.8 % , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever .
44481	Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months .
44486	We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .
44487	What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?
44488	If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty .
44489	The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment .
44491	Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
44493	Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .
44499	But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
44503	Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .
44508	This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .
44513	The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .
44514	That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
44515	Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
44518	And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
44519	This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it .
44522	Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 .
44524	While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .
44525	A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .
44528	Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .
44530	Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
44531	`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
44534	The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ''
44537	But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late-afternoon rout .
44539	The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
44542	There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
44547	With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
44548	Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall .
44550	All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
44554	`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in '' the market .
44558	But then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said .
44564	There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .
44566	Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum .
44567	But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 .
44568	On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval .
44575	Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
44579	James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` Terrible Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started .
44580	This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
44584	Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late-afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .
44586	But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday .
44587	According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy .
44590	Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .
44592	For example , Halliburton jumped 3 1\/4 to 38 , Schlumberger rose 2 1\/2 to 43 1\/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1\/8 to 22 .
44593	Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
44595	Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3\/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1\/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares .
44598	Merrill Lynch added 1 3\/4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3\/4 to 18 1\/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3\/8 to 14 1\/4 .
44600	At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel .
44603	Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said .
44606	He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today . ''
44612	Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly .
44614	Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close .

44623	A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .
44624	The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less .
44625	The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .
44628	As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast .
44630	The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver .
44633	Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
44634	Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members .
44635	In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .
44638	Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost .
44639	The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental .
44641	Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying .
44642	The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates .
44644	Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .
44645	The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
44648	Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for Amtrak , including $ 85 million for capital improvements .
44649	And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $ 1.625 billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year .
44650	Enjoying several blockbuster movie hits including `` Batman , '' Los Angeles-based Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared with a year-earlier loss .
44651	Sony Corp. , which has offered to acquire the movie-production company , is seeking to free its top executives , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
44652	Sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire Columbia for $ 3.4 billion , or $ 27 a share .
44653	Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week ; Sony and Guber-Peters have countersued , charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony 's acquisition of the two companies .
44654	Guber-Peters 's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ 6.9 million , or 62 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
44655	The company said revenue rose 138 % , to $ 10.9 million from $ 4.6 million , reflecting the success of its movies `` Gorillas in the Mist '' and `` Rainman , '' as well as the box-office smash `` Batman .
44657	As previously reported , Huntsman Holdings Corp. , owned by Jon M. Huntsman and other members of his family , proposed that Banstar Corp. , an affiliate of Huntsman Holdings , acquire Aristech in a friendly transaction for $ 25-a-share in cash , or $ 817.5 million .
44658	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Huntsman group said it controls 2,720,675 Aristech common shares , including 306,000 shares bought from Aug. 21 to Oct. 13 for $ 20 to $ 20.875 per share .

44666	Waterford Wedgwood PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts -LRB- $ 14.9 million -RRB- from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier .
44669	The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts , compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period .
44673	Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company 's long-term prospects .
44675	The setback , in which Treasury bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking .
44680	That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
44682	Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
44683	Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
44685	The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3\/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % .
44690	The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 3\/4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
44694	Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
44696	Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
44698	In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels .
44702	But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
44705	Jay Goldinger , who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said trading in Tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile .
44710	The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data , which includes the government 's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production .
44715	Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $ 2.3 billion offering of one-year , three-year , five-year and 10-year maturities .
44716	Tomorrow , the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue , which is expected to total between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years .
44720	`` We have a couple or three tough weeks coming . ''

44734	The 13-week bills mature Jan. 18 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 19 , 1990 .
44746	Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities , but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon .
44747	Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4\/32 , down 30\/32 from Friday ; 9 1\/2 % securities were down 27\/32 at 100 5\/32 ; and 10 % securities were at 102 2\/32 , off 24\/32 .
44751	Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week 's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals .
44755	Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1\/4 to 3\/4 point lower in late dealings .
44757	Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness .
44758	Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash was n't at hand .
44763	The 7 1\/8 % issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York , due 2019 , was off 5\/8 at 98 1\/8 bid .
44766	BMA Corp. , Kansas City , Mo. , said it 's weighing `` strategic alternatives , '' for its Business Men 's Assurance Co. unit , and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation .
44767	A BMA spokesman said `` runaway medical costs '' have made health insurance `` a significant challenge , '' and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life-insurance products consumers now demand .
44768	The Business Men 's Assurance unit represented about $ 288 million of the company 's $ 488 million in 1988 revenue , and the unit 's operating income was about $ 10 million , said the spokesman .
44771	A spokesman for Laidlaw declined to disclose the price the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares , which he said were acquired `` over the last couple of weeks . ''
44773	ADT , a security services and auctions company , trades on London 's Stock Exchange .
44774	Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd. , a Montreal transportation , resources and industrial holding concern .
44775	Nintendo Co. , a Japanese maker of video games , electronic information systems and playing cards , posted a 23 % unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen -LRB- $ 429 million -RRB- from 50 billion yen -LRB- $ 349.9 million -RRB- for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 .
44778	Pershare net fell to 423.3 yen from 457.7 yen because of expenses and capital adjustments .
44779	Without detailing specific product breakdowns , Nintendo credited its bullish upsurge in sales -- including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems -- to surging `` leisure-oriented '' sales in foreign markets .
44783	`` There is no pressing need to sell the unit , but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business , renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad , '' said William Slider , Hertz 's executive vice president .
44787	Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S. , France , Spain and the U.K .
44788	It supplies commercial and industrial equipment including earth-moving , aerial , compaction and electrical equipment , compressors , cranes , forklifts and trucks .
44790	It said the loss resulted from startup and introduction costs related to a new medical ultrasound equipment system .
44791	In the year-earlier quarter , the company reported net income of $ 955,000 , or 15 cents a share .
44792	The manufacturer of ultrasound diagnostic systems , based in Ambler , Pa. , reported a nine-month net loss of $ 2.43 million compared with net income of $ 2.71 million , or 44 cents a share , for the nine-month period a year earlier .
44794	Allegheny Ludlum Corp. expects to report third-quarter net of about $ 34 million , or $ 1.50 a share , down from $ 38.4 million , or $ 1.70 a share , a year earlier , Richard P. Simmons , chairman and chief executive officer , told institutional investors in New York .
44795	Sales for the Pittsburgh-based producer of specialty steels and other materials fell to about $ 265 million in the third quarter from $ 320.5 million a year earlier , he said .
44796	He said the third-quarter estimate indicates profit for the nine months of $ 4.65 a share , `` almost equal to the full-year 1988 earnings '' of $ 108.6 million , or $ 4.81 a share .
44797	In the first nine months of 1988 , net was $ 85 million , or $ 3.76 a share .
44798	Mr. Simmons said the third-quarter results reflect continued improvements in productivity and operating margins .
44801	U.S. Banknote said it is in negotiations to sell `` certain facilities , '' which it did n't name , to a third party , and it needs the extension to try to reach a definitive agreement on the sale .
44803	Both of the New York-based companies print stock certificates and currency .
44808	Closely held U.S. Banknote offered the $ 7 a share , or $ 126 million , for as many as 14.9 million shares , or 78.6 % , of International Banknote 's shares outstanding .
44809	U.S. Banknote said that as of Oct. 13 , 16.1 million shares , or about 84.3 % of the fully diluted shares outstanding , had been tendered .
44811	Under the terms of the contract , New York-based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50 % of Regatta , a maker of men 's and women 's clothes sold primarily in department stores , under certain conditions .
44812	That 50 % is now held by Clifford Parker , Regatta 's president and chief executive officer , who will continue to manage Regatta 's operations under Gitano .
44813	In 1989 , Regatta will have sales `` in excess of $ 10 million '' and will show a profit , Mr. Parker said .
44814	Gitano , which makes budget-priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal-Mart , said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores .
44817	In the year-ago quarter , the natural gas concern had net income of $ 25.2 million , or 34 cents a share , on revenue of about $ 1.46 billion .
44820	The old and revised numbers both include over-allotment provisions .
44821	Enron said each unit will be priced in the $ 19-to-$21 range and will represent about 80 % of the partnership equity .
44823	Goldman , Sachs & Co. , and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are lead underwriters .
44824	Arthur M. Goldberg said he extended his unsolicited tender offer of $ 32 a share tender offer , or $ 154.3 million , for Di Giorgio Corp. to Nov. 1 .
44827	The offer , which also includes common and preferred stock purchase rights , was to expire last night at midnight .
44831	In August , Di Giorgio , a San Francisco food products and building materials marketing and distribution company , rejected Mr. Goldberg 's offer as inadequate .
44837	Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor .
44840	What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
44841	On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white .
44843	`` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division .
44845	But last year , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year .
44846	Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones .
44847	At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .
44848	The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began marketing T-Max 3200 , one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films .
44851	Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers .
44852	Slated for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an Agfa spokesman .
44857	For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye-catching and exotic .
44859	`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds .
44860	Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
44862	Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T-shirts .
44863	Richard Crisman , the account manager for the campaign , says Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
44864	`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
44866	Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch .
44867	Companies `` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says Marc L. Hauser , a Chicago photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine .
44868	Other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc .
44870	Using black and white , `` we can make housewives look like stars , '' says John Perrin .
44871	His On-Broadway Photography studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is booked solid for the next five .
44872	One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic .
44873	I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '
44877	Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .
44878	Black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
44883	Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes .
44887	The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment .
44888	`` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , '' says Ian Brightman , Beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer .
44889	But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
44890	They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints .
44891	`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute .
44893	You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
44894	But when Popular Photography , a leading magazine for photographers , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary , all were black and white .
44895	`` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America .
44897	McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a 21 % gain in third-quarter profit to $ 8.8 million , or 31 cents a share , from $ 7.2 million , or 25 cents a share .
44899	The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .
44900	For the nine months , the newspaper chain had almost a 23 % increase in profit to $ 23.6 million , or 83 cents a share , from $ 19.2 million , or 68 cents a share .
44902	McClatchy publishes the Sacramento -LRB- Calif . -RRB- Bee and Tacoma -LRB- Wash . -RRB- News Tribune , and other papers in Western states .
44904	Agip S.p . A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine , the state oil companies of Italy and France , respectively , submitted an offer to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A .
44907	Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
44910	While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
44911	The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
44912	The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March .
44917	A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end .
44920	Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .
44922	Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
44923	Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries .
44924	The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .
44926	The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
44931	Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home-building permits .
44932	Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns . ''
44936	`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .
44942	The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed within a few months , a BSN spokeswoman said .

44948	Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $ 281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca , saying it believes bondholders will recover only `` negligible principal . ''
44950	American Continental 's thrift unit , Los Angeles-based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
44953	The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa .
44955	The downgrades were prompted , Moody 's said , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust 's preferred stock .
44956	Moody 's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could , if completed , endanger the thrift 's funding and market position .
44957	THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .
44959	The rally erased about half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , but analysts are cautious about the market 's outlook .
44960	The dollar also rebounded , while bond prices plummeted and Treasury bill rates soared .
44971	The computer giant partly cited a stronger dollar and a delay in shipping a new high-end disk drive .

45034	Omnicare Inc. , which intends to expand its position in the medical and dental markets , said it acquired a cotton and gauze products division from closely held Sterile Products Corp. for $ 8.2 million .
45035	Omnicare said it expects the division to add `` substantial sales volume and to make a positive contribution to our earnings in 1990 and beyond . ''
45036	In 1988 the Cincinnati company earned $ 3.1 million , or 32 cents a share , on revenue of $ 148.5 million .
45037	Omnicare said the division operates under the trade name ACCO and supplies the medical and dental markets .
45039	Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands has built up a 6.7 % stake in the company .
45042	SHV , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC , has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks .
45046	Terms were n't disclosed , but a J.P. Industries spokesman said the amount J.P. Industries will get for the group is `` a little better than expected by the marketplace , and the marketplace had been expecting $ 25 million to $ 30 million . ''
45047	The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc .
45048	J.P. Industries , which is based in Ann Arbor , Mich. , said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations .

45051	A unit of troubled Southmark Corp. , the operator of nursing homes and retirement centers said it sustained a net loss of $ 1.6 million , or nine cents a share , compared with net income of $ 1.3 million , or eight cents a share , a year earlier .

45057	The new group will comprise all of United Biscuit 's manufacturing and marketing operations in the food sector apart from those based in the U.S. .
45058	United Biscuits said the combined group , which will include businesses such as McVities biscuits and Terry 's confectionery , will have annual sales of more than # 1.5 billion -LRB- $ 2.35 billion -RRB- and trading profit of more than # 160 million -LRB- $ 251 million -RRB- .
45059	`` The new structure will enable United Biscuits to focus clearly upon opportunities for planned growth during the 1990s , '' said Bob Clarke , deputy chairman and group chief executive .
45065	Shortly after that , Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated .
45066	Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to `` insult , disparate or belittle '' the election commission .
45067	The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government .
45070	Last year , the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba 's `` Afrika Korps '' from Angola and hold `` free and fair '' elections that would end South Africa 's control of Namibia .
45073	He interviewed Mr. O'Linn , head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court .
45074	After Mr. Stanley 's article was published in two Namibian newspapers , Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer .
45075	Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month .
45076	Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley 's detention .
45078	Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters .
45079	The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results .
45081	State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation 's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides .
45085	Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered .
45086	Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
45087	Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved .
45088	Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss .
45089	Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines .
45090	In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly .
45091	Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork .
45092	In commodity markets yesterday : PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , first falling and then later rising .
45097	Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .
45100	Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .
45101	The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ 9.60 .
45104	One analyst , Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market .
45106	There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said .
45109	This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said .
45120	Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved .
45122	Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .
45124	Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank .
45125	Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company .
45127	`` For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , '' he said .
45130	The LME stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n't .
45132	At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able to sustain the gain .
45133	`` It was simply overbought , '' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices .
45138	Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area .
45140	That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said .
45141	Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said .
45146	At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back .
45148	India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more , the analyst said .
45150	`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
45151	At any rate , she added , `` India needs the sugar , so it will be in sooner or later to buy it . ''
45153	The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork .
45159	A company spokesman said he believed the confusion was caused when James Batten , Knight-Ridder 's chairman and chief executive , told New York analysts two weeks ago that Knight-Ridder 's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would `` be behind a little bit '' from like period of
45161	The spokesman said he was `` comfortable '' with revised analysts ' projections that the company would report earnings of between 62 cents and 64 cents a share , compared with the 53 cents a share it reported for the 1988 third quarter .
45166	DD Acquisition is a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit and Cara Operations Ltd .

45173	Herbert M. Sandler , chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland , Calif. , savings-and-loan holding company , credited the high number of loans added to the company 's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance .
45175	In savings activity , Mr. Sandler said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989 , and topped $ 11 billion at quarter 's end for the first time in the company 's history .
45177	Whirlpool Corp. , Benton Harbor , Mich. , said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers .
45178	The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring .
45180	CFCs are widely used as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants .
45181	But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance .
45182	Whirpool said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture .
45184	Maxus said it did n't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field , which is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field , because the wells are similar to others drilled at its Intan and Widuri fields .
45186	The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels .
45187	Maxus , an independent oil and gas concern , is the operator and owns a 56 % interest in the new field , called Northeast Intan .

45231	The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity .
45234	As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. , he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn , his top stock trader , on the back .
45237	By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened .
45248	In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading .
45249	Other , more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo 's , but there were no free-fall declines .
45250	Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected .
45251	What 's more , such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling .
45253	In Somerset , Wis. , Adrian Sween , who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees .
45261	Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's .
45263	Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe .
45265	The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading .
45266	But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 .
45268	In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process .

45301	By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors .
45307	Mr. LeBaron , who manages $ 10 billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . ''
45311	Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
45315	Charles Clough , a strategist at Merrill Lynch , says bargain hunting had explained the Dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow .
45316	Moreover , the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected to rattle traders .
45317	Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying .
45323	`` We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other '' about the course of the economy .
45324	Ralph Holzfaster , a farmer and farm-supply store operator in Ogallala , Neb. , says of the last few days events , `` If anything good comes out of this , it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids . ''

45331	Skipper 's said the merger will help finance remodeling and future growth .
45332	Skipper 's previously turned down a $ 10-a-share proposal from National Pizza and Pizza Hut Inc. questioned whether the purchase would violate National Pizza 's franchise agreements .
45335	For the 12 weeks ended Sept. 3 , Skipper 's had net income of $ 361,000 , or 13 cents a share , compared with a net loss a year earlier .

45380	Included in the sale are Cluett units that make men 's shirts under the Arrow name , socks under the Gold Toe name and menswear through the Schoeneman division .
45381	The companies said the agreement is subject to Bidermann 's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals .
45385	Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets .
45386	But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc. , the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive .

45395	The name change and good will write-off could help solidify Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .
45404	Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
45407	Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .
45408	But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .
45411	Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much .
45420	Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ 147 million , makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems .
45421	The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped .
45423	Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line .
45426	The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .
45428	The stock has since softened , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading .
45430	Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .
45431	In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 .
45433	While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says .
45435	He also professes an `` evangelical '' fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared .
45436	Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors .
45441	He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November .
45445	The company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ 20.8 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985 .
45448	Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures .
45449	The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .
45452	Seven Big Board stocks -- UAL , AMR , BankAmerica , Walt Disney , Capital Cities\/ABC , Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group -- stopped trading and never resumed .
45459	Many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early Friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet .
45460	Then in a lightning plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume .
45465	In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday .
45467	Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , were extremely active all day Friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group .
45468	Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise .
45476	Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had .
45477	For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group , which closed down 3 7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , Delta Air Lines , which fell 7 3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and Philips Industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 .
45479	But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses .
45485	Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago .
45486	After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued to notch prices down .
45487	As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .
45491	This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings .
45492	-LRB- In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -RRB-
45500	I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
45501	Under another post-crash system , Big Board President Richard Grasso -LRB- Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an `` inter-exchange hot line '' to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board .
45502	He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders .
45503	At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line .
45505	But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
45506	At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again .
45514	The release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market .
45523	At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks .
45524	But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
45525	The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation .
45531	Mr. Phelan said , `` It will take another day or two '' to analyze who was buying and selling Friday .
45532	Concerning your Sept. 21 page-one article on Prince Charles and the leeches : It 's a few hundred years since England has been a kingdom .
45533	It 's now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , comprising Wales , Northern Ireland , Scotland , and ... oh yes , England , too .
45538	The company said a portion of the $ 32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air-charter operations .
45540	A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co. said it has made a $ 409 million cash bid for most of L.J. Hooker Corp. 's real-estate and shopping-center holdings .
45542	The group is led by Jay Shidler , chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu , and A. Boyd Simpson , chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization Inc .
45543	Mr. Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker .
45544	`` The assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than can be provided in L.J. Hooker 's current situation , said Mr. Simpson in an interview . ``
45545	Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell .
45546	We want to build and hold . ''
45549	Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee .
45551	Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co. , L.J. Hooker 's department-store chains .
45552	The offer covers the massive 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati , the 800,000 square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia , S.C. , and the 700,000 square-foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton , Colo .
45554	Other Hooker properties included are a 20-story office tower in midtown Atlanta , expected to be completed next February ; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio ; L.J. Hooker International , the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate , plus other shopping centers .
45556	`` We do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid , '' said Allan Campbell , the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett , in an interview .
45561	Mr. Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill-fated , $ 1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. , as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers , a Sacramento chain ; Sakowitz Inc. , the Houston-based retailer , and Parisian Inc. , the Southeast department-store chain .
45562	Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 .
45563	Since then , Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain .
45567	`` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr. Shidler .
45568	`` Managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties .
45572	The Treasury plans to raise $ 175 million in new cash Thursday by selling about $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills and redeeming $ 9.58 billion of maturing bills .
45573	The bills will be dated Oct. 26 and will mature Oct. 25 , 1990 .
45575	Bids must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Thursday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
45578	And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .
45579	At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 .
45582	`` Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , '' said C. Bruce Johnstone , who runs Fidelity Investments ' $ 5 billion Equity-Income Fund .
45592	Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year .
45593	Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion Magellan Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million .
45594	One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September .
45598	That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 .
45602	Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels .
45605	Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday .
45606	And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines .
45608	If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg .
45611	But most investors were seeking share prices and other information .
45614	They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987 .
45626	Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits .
45628	Elaine Garzarelli , who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's $ 335 million Sector Analysis Portfolio , predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and `` some panic selling . ''
45629	But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs .
45632	`` Half of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but I 'm trying to talk them out of it . ''
45635	Two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say .
45636	`` From the investors ' standpoint , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on Black Monday , said Stephen Boesel , manager of the $ 580 million T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund .
45638	Newport Corp. said it expects to report fiscal-first-quarter earnings of between 15 cents and 19 cents a share , somewhat below analysts ' estimates of 19 cents to 23 cents .
45639	The maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months .
45640	A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the yearearlier quarter 's figure , when Newport reported net income of $ 1.7 million , or 21 cents a share , on $ 14.1 million in sales .
45642	Peter Otradovec , vice president for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines .
45643	Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas .
45647	At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N.J. ; and Palmdale , Calif. -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries .
45650	`` I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , '' Tom Baker , president of Machinists ' District 751 , said in an interview yesterday .
45652	America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be .
45653	`` I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all , '' Mr. Otradovec said .
45655	Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time .
45658	American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable .
45659	In Seattle , a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike .
45660	Meanwhile , supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company 's Everett , Wash. , plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout .
45661	As of Friday , four had been delivered and a fifth plane , a 747-400 , was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China .
45666	`` The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc .
45668	But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month , hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week .
45672	But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . ''
45673	He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime .
45674	In separate developments : -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the Calabasas , Calif. , aerospace company .
45676	It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
45683	A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out `` for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike . ''
45685	Atco Ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 851 million -RRB- , in Great Britain and elsewhere .
45686	C.S. Richardson , Atco 's senior vice president , finance , said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including Britain , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program .
45689	`` But we would n't go into them alone , '' and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said .
45690	`` Ideally , we 'd like to be the operator -LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity investor .
45692	Mr. Richardson would n't offer specifics regarding Atco 's proposed British project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities .
45693	Britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion -LRB- $ 31.05 billion -RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month .
45695	Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 .
45696	Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$ 1.16 billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers .
45697	`` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr. Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it .
45700	`` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , '' said Bruce Stram , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator .
45702	PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share .
45703	In the year-ago quarter , the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , on revenue of about $ 41.4 million .
45705	CONCORDE trans-Atlantic flights are $ 2,400 to Paris and $ 3,200 to London .
45708	The well flowed at a rate of 2.016 million cubic feet of gas a day through a 16 64-inch opening at depths between 5,782 and 5,824 feet .
45712	The partnership , Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp. , a unit of Heitman Financial Corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , Calif .
45714	The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals .
45715	The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad .
45717	Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .
45720	The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .
45726	But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting .
45727	Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million .
45736	Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 .
45737	Mr. Stookey , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction .
45738	Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .
45740	But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings .
45743	Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .
45748	Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product .
45753	No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle .
45754	One doubter is George Krug , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks .
45771	Two workers died and six remain in the hospital .
45773	Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards .
45775	When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward .
45776	But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting .
45777	`` You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that , '' recalls Theodore Semegran , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer .
45780	The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production .
45791	Asked about a bid for Quantum , a BP spokesman says , `` We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category .
45793	A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money .
45794	The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB\/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson .
45797	The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices .
45804	The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .
45805	Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community .
45806	Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 .
45807	Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 .
45810	Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel .
45813	It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments .
45819	The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent .
45825	Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program .
45826	The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela .
45828	That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance .
45830	These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration 's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .
45831	Elcotel Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a `` much stronger '' performance in its second half .
45832	Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 .
45834	George Pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million .
45838	Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country .
45839	Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data .
45841	Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls .
45843	The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel lobbies , office lobbies , hospitality lounges and similar settings .
45844	Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
45845	Britain 's retail price index rose 0.7 % in September from August and was up 7.6 % for the year , the Central Statistical Office said .
45847	The company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for Quest , a maker and marketer of hospital products .
45848	The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15 % of the company 's common stock or announces a tender offer .
45862	While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .
45866	But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .
45867	P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .
45876	Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker .
45879	`` This is something P&G would do with or without Kao , '' says Mr. Zurkuhlen .
45880	With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .
45882	Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view .
45885	He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan .
45886	But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . ''
45887	She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest . ''
45889	American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills .
45894	Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . ''
45899	I do n't feel either hard or soft .
45900	I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . ''
45901	When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill .
45903	But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition .
45904	She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets .
45907	`` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . ''
45910	Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise .
45914	Traditional Industries Inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended June 30 and is seeking new financing .
45915	The seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives , including seeking increases in its credit lines .
45916	Traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year .
45917	In the year ended June 30 , 1988 , Traditional reported net income of $ 4.9 million , or $ 1.21 a share .
45919	In the latest nine months net income was $ 4.7 million , or $ 1.31 a share , on revenue of $ 44.3 million .
45920	Separately , the company said it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission `` within approximately 45 days . ''
45924	A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties .
45927	The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co .
45931	A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas .
45934	Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability .
45935	The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance .
45936	The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview .
45937	`` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .
45939	But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings .
45940	So , too , many analysts predict , will Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp .
45945	Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand .
45947	Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower .
45949	`` Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said William Randol , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp .
45950	Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize .
45953	Refiners say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter .
45954	During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits .
45957	Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter .
45963	Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use .
45970	Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 .
45971	They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products .
45976	A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details .
45980	Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community .
45984	But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc .
45990	The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % .
45994	Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position .
45997	Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $ 284 million in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds .
45999	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million .
46001	Officials at Drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment .
46003	Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels .
46005	Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds .
46006	Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company .
46008	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them , the company said .
46010	HOFI , the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd. , previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60 % stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67 % stake in Ideal .
46015	The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders .
46017	While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high .
46025	In response to dwindling domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments .
46027	It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 .
46034	The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .
46036	Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago .
46039	The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices .
46042	Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go .
46045	However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 .
46046	Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time .
46051	It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said .
46053	Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said .
46057	Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .
46063	Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes .
46064	There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell .
46065	Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria .
46066	If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company said .
46067	Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market .
46068	But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .
46070	And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi .
46074	The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi .
46075	Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies .
46076	The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .
46078	That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 .
46079	Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state .
46083	`` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel .
46088	Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring , or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone , led by him .
46097	As expected , Young & Rubicam Inc. along with two senior executives and a former employee , pleaded not guilty in federal court in New Haven , Conn. , to conspiracy and racketeering charges .
46099	A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's office said extradition proceedings are `` just beginning '' for the other two defendants in the case , Eric Anthony Abrahams , former Jamaican tourism minister , and Jamaican businessman Arnold Foote Jr .
46101	The Samsung Group and Bozell Inc. agreed to establish a joint venture advertising agency in South Korea .
46102	Bozell Cheil Corp. , as the new agency will be called , will be based in Seoul and is 70 % owned by Samsung and 30 % owned by Bozell .
46104	Bozell joins Backer Spielvogel Bates and Ogilvy Group as U.S. agencies with interests in Korean agencies .
46105	Citing a payment from a supplier and strong sales of certain data-storage products , Maxtor Corp. said earnings and revenue jumped in its second quarter ended Sept. 24 .
46106	The maker of computer-data-storage products said net income rose to $ 4.8 million , or 23 cents a share , from year-earlier net of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share .
46109	Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue .
46110	A spokeswoman would n't elaborate , but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit .
46111	Operationally , Maxtor benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high-end personal computers and computer workstations .
46112	In the fiscal first half , net was $ 7 million , or 34 cents a share , up from the year-earlier $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share .
46114	Robert G. Walden , 62 years old , was elected a director of this provider of advanced technology systems and services , increasing the board to eight members .
46115	He retired as senior vice president , finance and administration , and chief financial officer of the company Oct. 1 .
46116	Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission , but that the filing does n't include its audited financial statements and related information .
46117	The real estate and thrift concern , operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings , said it told the SEC it could n't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension `` without unreasonable burden or expense . ''
46122	Mr. Seelenfreund is executive vice president and chief financial officer of McKesson and will continue in those roles .
46124	Messrs. Malson and Seelenfreund are directors of McKesson , which has an 86 % stake in PCS .
46128	In its lawsuit , Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block MedChem from selling the AMVISC products .
46129	A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem 's sales and 10 % to 20 % of its earnings .
46130	In the year ended Aug. 31 , 1988 , MedChem earned $ 2.9 million , or 72 cents a share , on sales of $ 17.4 million .
46131	MedChem said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a `` first-phase trial '' in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case .
46135	Newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results , aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage , especially in the Northeast .
46136	Adding to unsteadiness in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry .
46137	In New York , the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , while the R.H. Macy & Co. , Bloomingdale 's and Saks Fifth Avenue department-store chains are for sale .
46139	Until recently , industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters .
46141	`` Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run , '' said Edward J. Atorino , industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
46143	For instance , Gannett Co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at USA Today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates .
46144	Gannett 's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue .
46145	Total advertising linage was `` modestly '' lower as classified-ad volume increased , while there was `` softer demand '' for retail and national ad linage , said John Curley , Gannett 's chief executive officer .
46147	While USA Today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled 2,735 , a decrease of 4 % from last year , the paper 's ad revenue increased 8 % in the quarter and 13 % in the nine months .
46148	In the nine months , Gannett 's net rose 9.5 % to $ 270 million , or $ 1.68 a share , from $ 247 million , or $ 1.52 a share .
46151	Net fell to $ 28.8 million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share .
46152	The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a share .
46154	The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
46157	The publisher of the Boston Globe reported net of $ 8.5 million , or 12 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 26.5 million , or 38 cents a share , for the third quarter in 1988 .
46158	William O. Taylor , the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer , said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the Boston newspaper .
46162	Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers .
46164	New York Times Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate , Forest Products Group .
46165	`` Times Co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well , but there is little sign that things will improve in the New York market , '' said Alan Kassan , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton .
46166	Washington Post Co. is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area .
46168	The news-weekly has faced heightened competition from rival Time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market .
46169	Knight-Ridder Inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its Detroit Free Press and Gannett 's Detroit News , and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter .
46170	However , analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers , such as the Miami Herald and San Jose Mercury News .
46171	`` The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years '' when Knight-Ridder `` was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling , '' said Bruce Thorp , an analyst for Provident National Bank .
46172	General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .
46173	In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .
46180	GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
46183	The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said .
46185	That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .
46186	The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio .
46187	Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
46188	But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec .
46189	Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .
46190	GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .
46191	That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures .
46194	At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die .
46201	Merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of `` net benefit '' to Canada .
46204	Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns .
46207	He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
46208	`` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology .
46210	Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week .
46213	`` This has become a very politicized deal , concerning Canada 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company , '' Mr. Mehta said .
46217	While neither side will disclose its contents , Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada .
46218	Some analysts , such as Murray Grossner of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields Inc. , believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders , such as Switzerland 's Ciba-Geigy and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville , Calif .
46221	Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares .
46226	Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .
46227	Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November .
46228	The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments .
46229	Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt .
46233	Analysts said that Merck & Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins .
46234	Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines .
46235	Joseph Riccardo , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs .
46237	Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % .
46239	Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication .
46241	In the third quarter of 1988 , Merck earned $ 311.8 million , or 79 cents a share .
46246	In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ 171.4 million , or $ 1.20 a share .
46248	Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ 87.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it reported in the like period last year .
46249	The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins .
46253	Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease .
46256	Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because `` those companies are really managed well . ''
46257	ScheringPlough earned $ 94.4 million , or 84 cents a share , while Bristol-Myers earned $ 232.3 million , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier .
46261	Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition .
46263	In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ 216.8 million , or $ 1.29 a share .
46265	Analysts said they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago .
46266	Upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax , a tranquilizer , and Halcion , a sedative .
46267	Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs .
46268	Also , the company 's hair-growing drug , Rogaine , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said .
46274	Relational Technology reported net income of $ 1.5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
46275	`` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said Paul Newton , president and chief executive officer .
46276	A spokesman said the company 's first quarter is historically soft , and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales .
46277	Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned .
46282	In the previous quarter , the company earned $ 4.5 million , or 37 cents a share , on sales of $ 47.2 million .
46283	The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden , a great zoo , its own charming Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and , of course , the Yankees .
46286	In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` Sleeping Arrangements '' -LRB- Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell-kitten Diana , age five -RRB- .
46287	Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall .
46288	She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue .
46289	In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class people lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii .
46291	Sharp-witted and funny but never mean , she 's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote , if he 'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy .
46294	Rosie reinvented this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for Lily 's benefit .
46295	Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets .
46296	The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure .
46297	`` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes .
46301	Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting .
46302	When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements .
46303	They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions .
46304	With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover President on a good-will mission . ''
46306	Lily 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress , `` Philosophy for Women . ''
46307	The book loses some momentum toward the end , when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family .
46310	But both the past and present worlds of `` The Current Climate '' -LRB- Atlantic Monthly Press , 200 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- feel cramped and static .
46312	Harry is now a 57-year-old writer , whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch .
46316	Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan .
46321	The 21-square-mile area is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals .
46324	The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement .
46325	The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company said .
46326	Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law . ''
46333	Many of the nation 's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday 's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players .
46334	Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating .
46341	The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes .
46342	`` I 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , '' said Kenneth Olsen , Digital Equipment Corp. president , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 86.50 .
46345	`` The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem . ''
46346	Of course , established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists .
46347	Indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump .
46348	Asked whether Friday 's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate , Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said : `` No comment . ''
46350	Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in `` both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , '' said Lewis Preston , chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council .
46351	The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market .
46352	In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill .
46353	Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom .
46361	A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents .
46366	`` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , '' says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc .
46367	He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market .
46369	In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . ''
46371	It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt .
46372	Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp .
46377	Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .
46379	By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot .
46383	It makes investment castings and has traded over-the-counter .
46395	This role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens .
46397	Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .
46398	Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it ; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad .
46400	But always , in years past , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases .
46406	`` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he said .
46409	Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights .
46410	`` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month .
46414	`` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he says .
46417	Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years .
46420	He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin Luther King 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech from the 1963 March on Washington .
46421	Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others .
46423	`` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , '' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created .
46424	The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth .
46426	Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida .
46428	Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets .
46431	Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting .
46435	NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market , and in Florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities .
46436	The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency .
46439	NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets .
46451	It will also purchase $ 473 million in assets , and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the RTC .
46452	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
46454	Limited Inc. , offering of up to $ 300 million of debt securities and warrants .
46455	Nuveen California Performance Plus Municipal Fund Inc. , initial offering of five million common shares , via Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. , John Nuveen & Co. , Prudential-Bache Capital Funding , and Bateman Eichler , Hill Richards .
46456	PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. , proposed offering of 1.5 million common shares , of which 700,000 shares will be offered by PacifiCare and 800,000 shares by UniHealth America Inc . -LRB- PacifiCare 's 71 % -RRB- , via Dillon , Read & Co. Inc. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
46457	Pricor Inc. , offering of one million new shares of common stock and 300,000 shares by holders , via Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and J.C. Bradford & Co .
46459	Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways .
46460	In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .
46463	Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .
46464	In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers .
46465	Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .
46470	Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers .
46471	`` What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann .
46472	`` We are trying to create quality and involvement . ''
46479	Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away .
46481	Time 's rivals news-weeklies , Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report , are less reliant on electronic giveaways , and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases .
46482	Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month .
46486	It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks .
46490	CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV .
46493	So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network .
46495	The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism .
46497	To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program .
46498	It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers .
46503	It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see .
46504	And the cable-TV operators -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .
46505	The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive .
46506	Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future .
46507	In addition , many cable-TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations .
46509	Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research .
46511	The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .
46514	It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks .
46515	It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .
46519	And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King Live '' and `` Crossfire '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep people tuned in .
46520	Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier .
46522	But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so CNN wants in .
46525	`` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report .
46533	CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks .
46541	In the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound .
46545	When you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation .
46549	The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
46551	Terms were n't disclosed , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually .
46552	Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
46557	Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors .
46558	The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments .
46560	Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law .
46561	The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year .
46564	Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including FSLIC . ''
46566	But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas .
46572	`` We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize .
46574	Mr. Thygerson said he had planned to travel between the job in Denver and his San Diego home , but has found the commute too difficult to continue .
46576	SOUTH AFRICA FREED the ANC 's Sisulu and seven other political prisoners .
46583	The Soviet Union reported that thousands of tons of goods needed to ease widespread shortages across the nation were piled up at ports and rail depots , and food shipments were rotting because of a lack of people and equipment to move the cargo .
46584	Strikes and mismanagement were cited , and Premier Ryzhkov warned of `` tough measures . ''
46585	Bush indicated there might be `` room for flexibility '' in a bill to allow federal funding of abortions for poor women who are vicitims of rape and incest .
46586	He reiterated his opposition to such funding , but expressed hope of a compromise .
46596	South Korea 's President Roh traveled to the U.S. for a five-day visit that is expected to focus on ties between Washington and Seoul .
46597	Roh , who is facing calls for the reduction of U.S. military forces in South Korea , is to meet with Bush tomorrow and is to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday .
46598	China 's Communist leadership voted to purge the party of `` hostile and anti-party elements '' and wealthy private businessmen , whom they called exploiters .
46603	Zaire 's President Mobutu met in southern France with Angolan rebel leader Savimbi and a senior U.S. envoy in a bid to revive an accord to end Angola 's civil war .
46613	The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August .
46616	One week later , Leonard H. Roberts , president and chief executive officer of Arby 's , was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner .
46618	The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system .
46619	We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . ''
46620	The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings .
46621	In Florida , Renee Mottram , a senior vice president at DWG , responded : `` We do n't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self-serving motives .
46622	September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday .
46627	That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
46630	`` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .
46631	But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump .
46641	Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated .
46645	`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .
46646	Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer .
46655	Prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped 1.1 % after declining 1.9 % in August and edging up 0.2 % in July .
46656	Here are the Labor Department 's producer price indexes -LRB- 1982 = 100 -RRB- for September , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from September , 1988 .
46658	In the year-earlier period , CityFed had net income of $ 485,000 , but no per-share earnings .
46659	CityFed 's president and chief executive officer , John Atherton , said the loss stems from several factors .
46660	He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 516 million between June and September .
46662	Accordingly , CityFed estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter .
46664	City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida .
46667	CityFed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations .
46669	He added , however : `` Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range .
46671	In a statement , Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends .
46673	David L. Paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision , which issued the directive , saying it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons .
46676	In March , regulators labeled CenTrust a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses .
46681	Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
46682	The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the SEC and do n't have a ready market .
46683	CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds .
46684	The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .
46685	Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market .
46688	In a statement Friday , Mr. Paul challenged the regulators ' decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank . ''
46693	Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now .
46695	Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .
46696	CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion .
46697	It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards .
46699	Critics , however , say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .
46701	The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .
46705	As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A. Law . ''
46707	The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe .
46709	A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why .
46710	While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect .
46711	More European air time is filled with low-budget game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock-offs of their American counterparts .
46717	Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes .
46719	European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that .
46720	Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens .
46728	There is , for instance , `` One Man and His Dog , '' a herding contest among sheep dogs .
46729	Also riveting to the British are hours of dart-throwing championships , even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons .
46732	A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident .
46733	`` Schwarzwaldklinik , '' -LRB- Black Forest Clinic -RRB- , a kind of German `` St . Elsewhere '' set in a health spa , is popular in Germany , and has spread into France .
46734	Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia .
46741	`` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes Colin Young , head of Britain 's National Film Theatre School .
46743	Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising .
46744	Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are .
46745	But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .
46746	Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
46748	The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
46749	But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. .
46753	Lisa Grishaw-Mueller in Bonn , Laura Colby in Milan , Tim Carrington in London and Carlta Vitzhum in Madrid contributed to this article .
46754	British Aerospace PLC and France 's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors .
46755	The 50-50 joint venture , which may be dubbed Eurodynamics , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion -LRB- $ 2.17 billion -RRB- and would be among the world 's largest missile makers .
46756	After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance .
46758	The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting .
46759	In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture .
46760	Already , British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system .
46762	The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry .
46763	Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC .
46764	But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford , Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces .
46765	Yesterday , a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF .
46766	Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group .
46767	But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated .
46769	Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry .
46770	A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials .
46775	For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .
46778	The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H .
46779	In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership .
46785	Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate .
46787	`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .
46788	Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .
46790	Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .
46791	The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .
46793	Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .
46794	Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal .
46795	Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .
46796	That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .
46803	Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .
46804	In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion .
46805	The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter .
46806	At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .
46807	The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit .
46808	The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .
46810	In the year-earlier third quarter , when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the company had net of $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , on sales of $ 1.02 billion .
46812	Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether .
46821	To illustrate , Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results .
46822	Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co. , Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , generally solid performers in the past .
46826	In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share .
46831	In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .
46832	Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , Adobe 's biggest customer , and Microsoft rebelled .
46833	Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe 's approach , and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM , the biggest seller of personal computers , along with them .
46839	`` It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , '' said Russ Crabs , an analyst at Soundview Financial Group .
46845	IBM is backing one type of bus called microchannel , while the nine other leading computer makers , including H-P and Compaq Computer Corp. , have chosen another method .
46847	He said Apple 's family of Macintosh computers , for instance , uses four different buses `` and no one seems to mind . ''
46848	The gap between winners and laggards will grow .
46849	In personal computers , Apple , Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business .
46853	`` Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said Kimball Brown , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities .
46856	Ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with one or more microprocessors as their `` brains , '' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes .
46858	As a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses H-P , IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own .
46864	So are Indiana , Ohio and Michigan .
46867	Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says .
46869	Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people .
46870	Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin .
46873	And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again .
46874	At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround .
46875	Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska .
46876	Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue .
46877	But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
46887	But even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 .
46889	Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 .
46891	More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .
46893	MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family .
46894	At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates .
46896	Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group .
46898	Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 .
46901	Across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive .
46902	Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it .
46908	Odds and Ends
46909	THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 .
46910	The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 .
46913	The amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ 16,489 in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ 15,472 in 1987 .
46916	About 54 % are women , and 44 % are part-time students .
46918	Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool .
46921	Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison 's main street .
46925	Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables .
46926	With today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , `` people do n't want to just sit around and drink . ''
46927	Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski , where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop .
46928	At the lounge , manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans , T-shirts or tennis shoes .
46933	After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats .
46938	The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS 's new show `` Island Son '' -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 25 -RRB- was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework .
46940	Richard Chamberlain dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves .
46946	A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City .
46948	Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .
46949	Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company .
46954	As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .
46955	He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''
46957	It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .
46961	These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .
46962	The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .
46963	In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .
46966	Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .
46967	That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
46969	The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?
46970	Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .
46973	In `` Chicken Soup , '' Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie -LRB- Lynn Redgrave -RRB- , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- Rita Karin -RRB- and her brother Michael -LRB- Brandon Maggart -RRB- .
46975	At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie .
46977	And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam .
46978	Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .
46979	And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .
46980	Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .
46981	So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
46984	For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .
46985	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .
46986	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .
46994	`` The economy , '' he added , `` remains well-balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''
46999	After the 1929 crash , Herbert Hoover said : `` The fundamental business of the country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis .
47000	James Robinson , 57 years old , was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives .
47001	He has been president and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp. , a division of North American Philips Corp. , itself a subsidiary of N.V . Philips of the Netherlands .
47003	The former president and chief executive , Eric W. Markrud , resigned in June .
47006	Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases .
47010	House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .
47012	But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year . ''
47016	The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year .
47019	And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year . ''
47020	One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .
47027	`` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate . ''
47030	But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .
47032	These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures .
47034	One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts .
47046	Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 .
47049	Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill .
47050	The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years .
47057	-- Raise $ 851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes .
47059	-- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals , such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam , beginning at $ 1.10 a pound starting next year .
47063	-- Increase to $ 6 a person from $ 3 the international air-passenger departure tax , and impose a $ 3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships .
47064	The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees .
47070	-- Authority for the Federal Aviation Administration to raise $ 239 million by charging fees for commercial airline-landing rights at New York 's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports , O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and National Airport in Washington .
47073	-- Raising an additional $ 43 million by increasing existing Federal Communications Commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for amateur radio operators , ship stations and mobile radio facilities .
47076	I was laid off in August 1988 , and after a thorough and exhausting job search , was hired in August 1989 .
47077	My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a job ; I found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies .
47078	The statistics quoted by the `` new '' Census Bureau report -LRB- garnered from 1984 to 1986 -RRB- are out of date , certainly as an average for the Northeast , and possibly for the rest of the country .
47079	I think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well -- if you 're getting laid off do n't worry , and if you 're unemployed , it 's a seller 's market .
47082	Looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life -- and is for most people .
47089	The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade .
47095	The rating concern said Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries .
47101	Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do .
47103	`` I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer .
47105	`` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .
47107	Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out .
47115	This was an October massacre '' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 .
47117	So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained .
47118	`` Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she says .
47123	She says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . ''
47136	`` We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again .
47143	I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management .
47144	Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush .
47145	`` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . ''
47146	He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .
47153	`` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying .
47159	`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .
47160	This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . ''
47163	`` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . ''
47168	These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue .
47170	He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge .
47173	`` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , Quantum Fund .
47176	Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ''
47177	If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much .
47178	Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go .
47179	He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
47187	Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. Terrizzi , president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati .
47188	Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally .
47191	Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing , alleging :
47192	1 . That your Sept. 28 editorial `` Kangaroo Committees '' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading .
47193	I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative .
47201	As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment .
47204	My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court ... etc . ''
47206	By any `` reasonable man '' criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted .
47217	Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?
47220	4 . That the Journal defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , '' etc. and so forth .
47221	No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ... ''
47222	it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .
47223	The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body .
47229	But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate .
47236	Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . ''
47238	The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ''
47240	Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
47241	He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
47242	Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
47245	The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .
47249	It was Friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points .
47252	In academia , a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .
47253	Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th .
47260	In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .
47261	reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered .
47264	Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges .
47265	Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 .
47267	By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % .
47268	On Oct. 16 , 1987 , the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.18 points , or 3.8 % , followed by its devastating 46.12-point , or 11 % slide , three days later .
47273	Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .
47274	The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash .
47276	There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots .
47284	When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast .
47291	`` Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit .
47300	Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent .
47306	The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers .
47308	Shearson 's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt .
47310	`` We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said .
47313	In addition , Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market .
47315	The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 .
47316	The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or 9.31 , to 462.98 .
47319	McCaw Cellular Communications , for instance , has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as Metromedia 's New York City cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular .
47320	McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 .
47321	LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 .
47327	Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; MCI Communications slipped 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/2 ; Apple Computer fell 3 to 45 3\/4 and Nike dropped 2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 .
47329	The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
47379	Pension funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday 's market rout .
47381	Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .
47383	They could still panic and bail out of the market .
47385	`` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said John W. Rogers , president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks .
47393	`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn .
47395	Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .
47399	`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif .
47403	`` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp .
47404	Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days .
47406	He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading .
47409	Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts .
47410	In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .
47422	`` We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day .
47423	Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore .
47424	Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes .
47425	Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests .
47428	Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said .
47429	Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug .
47433	The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders .
47436	ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders .
47439	A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue .
47441	Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy-making .
47443	`` I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't .
47450	The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill .
47451	`` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press . ''
47452	-- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .
47454	`` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
47457	But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision .
47461	Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .
47463	And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous .
47464	The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .
47466	Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .
47467	One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble .
47471	But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ''
47473	`` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- .
47474	Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight .
47475	Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .
47476	`` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . ''
47477	During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds .
47481	Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest .
47482	Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .
47483	`` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H . -RRB- . said yesterday .
47484	The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .
47485	Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''
47490	`` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .
47491	The following U.S. Treasury , corporate and municipal offerings are tentatively scheduled for sale this week , according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
47492	$ 15.2 billion of three-month and six-month bills .
47524	$ 68,230,000 of various bonds , including $ 32 million hotel occupancy tax revenue bonds , Series 1989A , and $ 36.23 million convention center revenue bonds , Series 1989B , via a Morgan Stanley & Co. group .
47533	University of Medicine And Dentistry of New Jersey --
47535	West Virginia Parkways , Economic Development And Tourism Authority --
47538	$ 640 million of gas and electric revenue refunding bonds , via a First Boston group .
47541	Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market .
47544	`` I think on Monday the small -LRB- investors -RRB- are going to panic and sell , '' predicted Mr. Sullivan , whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds .
47545	`` And I think institutions are going to come in and buy ...
47550	Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more . ''
47553	But Robert Showalter , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned .
47557	Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines .
47561	Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it .
47562	`` I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . ''
47563	She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash , although she still owns some Texaco stock .
47564	Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school , `` I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid . ''
47569	Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared .
47575	Discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago , '' says Leslie Quick Jr. , chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm .
47580	Alan Helfman , general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston , said he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry .
47582	`` And I can tell you that a high roller is n't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati . ''
47585	Everything , '' said Pascal Antori , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office .
47591	Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially Zenith Electronics Corp. , the current market leader , and on a swarm of promising start-ups .
47593	One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . ''
47594	But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match .
47596	Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 .
47597	All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases .
47598	In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly .
47602	Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing .
47603	At 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth .
47605	Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs .
47607	Poquet Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much .
47611	`` Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter .
47618	Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .
47624	Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq .
47625	Compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like Dynabook Inc. , which introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , uses an Intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive .
47626	But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's .
47627	Compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull , the French government-owned computer maker .
47628	Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $ 635 million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales .
47630	Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk .
47634	`` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc .
47637	Compaq 's machines include the 3 1\/2-inch floppy disk drive , a backlit screen that is only 1\/4-inch thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine .
47638	Others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition .
47639	Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size .
47640	A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players .
47642	International Business Machines Corp. , analysts say , has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon .
47643	Honeywell Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. received Air Force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space .
47644	Honeywell 's contract totaled $ 69.7 million , and IBM 's $ 68.8 million .
47651	The index , which registered 156.8 at the end of September , has a base of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted .
47652	Prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , outstripping both the initial 3 % inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % .
47653	Japan 's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3 % from a year earlier and were up 0.4 % from the previous month , the Bank of Japan announced Friday .
47659	And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp .
47660	Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Exxon Corp. and Cigna Corp. , the big insurer .
47664	Other new lows included Navistar International Corp. , Union Carbide Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. , all of which are included in the industrial average .
47666	Shares of Rally 's Inc. , an operator of fast-food restaurants , closed at $ 17 each , up from its $ 15 offering price and shares of Employee Benefit Plans Inc. , a health-care consultant , closed at $ 14.125 , up from its $ 12 offering price .
47668	Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions , the company said .
47674	That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
47679	Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said .
47685	The Garden City , N.Y. , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year .
47686	But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines .
47687	Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .
47688	A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total .
47689	Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit .
47690	In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts .
47691	`` I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning .
47692	Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements .
47693	National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit .
47694	A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 .
47695	At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million .
47696	Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .
47698	Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent-flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . ''
47699	This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons .
47700	`` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said .
47703	`` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August .
47706	But CBS News will extend its four-hour `` Nightwatch '' by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m .
47707	The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co. , finishing far below `` Tonight '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` Nightline '' on ABC-TV , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc .
47709	Tandem Computers Inc. , preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
47710	Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
47712	In the year-earlier period , Tandem reported net income of $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $ 383.9 million .
47714	Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino , Calif. , company will report revenue of $ 430 million to $ 460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
47717	Tandem makes `` fault-tolerant '' computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems .
47728	`` The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , '' he said .
47735	It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .
47736	The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy .
47743	Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy .
47747	Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance .
47753	But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
47763	That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. .
47764	Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting .
47769	Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles .
47771	-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .
47772	'' Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction .
47779	Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations .
47782	The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors .
47785	A 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will .
47789	Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression .
47799	`` This could be the first of five or six down quarters . ''
47801	Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and housewares .
47802	Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ 3.20 a share and $ 3.30 a share , compared with $ 3.36 a year ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion .
47805	`` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , '' says James Wilbur , a Smith Barney analyst .
47809	Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments , fibers and polymers .
47813	In the 1988 third quarter , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a share , on sales of $ 7.99 billion .
47815	Monsanto Co. , too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S. .
47817	Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year , but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989 .
47818	Most estimates for Monsanto run between $ 1.70 and $ 2 a share .
47819	A year ago , the company posted third-quarter profit of $ 116 million , or $ 1.67 a share , on sales of $ 2.02 billion .
47822	By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may presage firmer demand .
47827	Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries .
47829	At Quantum Chemical Corp. , New York , the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene , higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion .
47832	In the 1988 third quarter , Quantum earned $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million .
47833	Another big polyethylene producer , Union Carbide Corp. , is expected to post profit of between $ 1 a share and $ 1.25 , compared with $ 1.56 a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ 213 million on sales of $ 2.11 billion .
47834	Himont , Quantum and Union Carbide all declined to comment .
47835	The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :
47839	Rated single-A-1 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the non-callable issue will be sold through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
47843	Rated Baa-1 by Moody 's and triple-B-plus by S&P , the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Co .
47847	Among classes for which details were available , yields ranged from 8.78 % , or 75 basis points over two-year Treasury securities , to 10.05 % , or 200 basis points over 10-year Treasurys .
47854	The agency 's first strips issue , collateralized by Freddie Mac 8 % securities pooled into a single security called a Giant , will be divided into interest-only and principal-only securities .
47859	Freddie Mac said the principal-only securities were priced at 58 1\/4 to yield 8.45 % , assuming an average life of eight years and a prepayment of 160 % of the PSA model .
47861	There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday .
47862	The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
47867	Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow .
47870	A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted .
47871	In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
47872	`` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
47873	Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
47874	Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
47879	`` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said .
47880	Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group .
47881	He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .
47891	Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms , American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain 's concept of both .
47895	According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young , high-flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .
47896	But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... ''
47898	The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .
47900	Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
47907	The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price .
47917	Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary-colored Porsche , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat-up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock .
47920	After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money .
47922	Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car .
47924	He takes his wash to the laundromat , where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe .
47925	In producing and promoting `` Capital City , '' Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day .
47926	The production costs are a not inconsiderable # 8 million -LRB- $ 12.4 million -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` Dealers , '' an earlier made-for-TV movie .
47927	Another half million quid went for a volley of full-page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway .
47928	These expenses create a special incentive for `` Capital City 's '' producers to flog it , or a Yank-oriented version of it , in America .
47930	He is discreetly hopeful , citing three U.S. comedy series -- `` Three 's Company , '' `` Too Close for Comfort '' and `` Check It Out '' -- that had British antecedents .
47931	Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` Capital City '' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British `` Carry On '' movies of the 1960s .
47934	And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles .
47935	Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge -LRB- Declan -RRB- for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank-faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies .
47943	The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers .
47946	Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa-Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans .
47947	In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
47948	The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said .
47949	Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
47950	He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers .
47953	`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said .
47954	Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
47955	The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
47956	Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion -LRB- $ 20.71 billion -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .
47958	The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''
47961	To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .
47962	Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .
47964	Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles .
47966	This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .
47969	Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .
47974	GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago .
47977	Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end .
47978	The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing , a company spokesman said .
47981	Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
47987	Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .
47989	At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .
47993	x - There were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier .
47995	Antonio L. Savoca , 66 years old , was named president and chief executive officer of the Atlantic Research Corp. subsidiary .
47998	Sequa makes and repairs jet engines .
47999	It also has interests in military electronics and electro-optics , marine transportation and machinery used to make food and beverage cans .
48000	It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies .
48002	Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe .
48004	In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it .
48005	But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one .
48011	`` The Hungarian -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''
48015	Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder .
48016	The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves , though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian .
48017	Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers , while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves .
48019	With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . ''
48020	Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts .
48021	They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz .
48023	Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable .
48025	Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location .
48027	It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- .
48034	`` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ''
48038	It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
48042	The Hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world .
48044	A daily 35-minute program called `` The March of Time '' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
48045	There 's a program for women and a science show .
48050	Proposals for government-operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .
48053	It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall .
48055	Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .
48056	If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
48061	This time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans .
48062	Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
48064	Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals .
48065	The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .
48067	The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .
48069	Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home .
48070	They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
48071	As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . ''
48074	What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ?
48075	In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris Dodd -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service work-study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs .
48077	It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators .
48078	The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard .
48086	What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill .
48087	To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .
48088	Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?
48090	Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .
48091	Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . ''
48092	So far , the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism .
48093	However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
48095	The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .
48096	National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of knee-socked youth performing works of `` civic content '' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors .
48099	Drug Emporium Inc. said Gary Wilber , 39 years old , who had been president and chief operating officer for the past year , was named chief executive officer of this drugstore chain .
48100	He succeeds his father , Philip T. Wilber , who founded the company and remains chairman .
48101	Robert E. Lyons III , 39 , who headed the company 's Philadelphia region , was appointed president and chief operating officer , succeeding Gary Wilber .
48104	American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals .
48105	Prime , based in Bedminster , N.J. , provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers .
48118	After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington .
48119	At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring .
48120	One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .
48121	An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted Nunn-McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee .
48125	Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .
48129	To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .
48132	Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations .
48133	But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ?
48136	Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?
48137	Short or long ?
48138	Part-time or full-time ?
48139	Paid or unpaid ?
48140	Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ?
48143	Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ?
48145	Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ?
48146	Youth only or all ages ?
48147	Middle-class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ?
48148	Many or few ?
48149	Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them .
48156	It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career .
48163	It is also unwise and unenforceable .
48165	But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
48166	It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .
48167	Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .
48170	There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply .
48171	Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality .
48173	Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale .
48174	Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year .
48181	People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost .
48182	They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .
48184	They are not enrolled in high school or college .
48186	And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .
48187	But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .
48191	Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation .
48194	But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .
48200	Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
48201	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .
48202	And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge .
48204	In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout .
48206	The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning .
48207	Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment .
48212	`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact .
48218	`` The economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''
48220	`` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named .
48223	Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world .
48224	The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe .
48225	Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments .
48227	After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower .
48228	In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady , Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins .
48230	As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
48232	He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges .
48233	Later , Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas .
48235	Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David .
48236	He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers .
48238	Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day .
48241	He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted 508 points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech .
48243	Also shown is the closing listed market price or a dealer-to-dealer asked price of each fund 's shares , with the percentage of difference .
48252	Resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks .
48255	And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months .
48260	The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began .
48261	The `` October massacres '' of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns .
48266	Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies .
48267	The best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says Marshall B. Front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion .
48269	On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy .
48270	`` This is all emotion right now , and when emotion starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said .
48271	`` So it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize . ''
48272	Roger Ibbotson , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Inc. , says , `` My real advice would be to just ride through it .
48273	Generally , it is n't wise to be in and out '' of the stock market .
48276	John Snyder , former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now .
48278	`` We understand panics and euphoria .
48279	And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge . ''
48281	Over the next days and weeks , they say , investors should look for stocks to buy .
48286	Stocks such as Hershey Foods Corp. , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says .
48288	`` It will be chaotic at first , but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , '' he says .
48289	He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 .
48290	Mr. Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction . ''
48291	His firm favors selected computer , drug and pollution-control stocks .
48293	They say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away .
48294	Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rallying .
48297	In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge .
48298	He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high .
48300	As a result , Mr. Fleckenstein says , `` I think the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market .
48302	He says the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors .
48303	One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index .
48306	The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis .
48314	James A. White and Tom Herman contributed to this article .
48316	The firm , which was acquired in April from Sears , Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out , had planned to sell up to $ 56.4 million of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees .
48317	Though the offering did n't sell out , James J. Didion , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` We 're pretty proud of the employees ' response . ''
48322	`` We 're in a service business , and in that context , it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success . ''
48324	Employees have the right to trade stock among themselves , and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions .
48325	They may also eventually sell the shares to third parties , but the outside investors who own the remaining 60 % of Coldwell Banker have the right to first refusal .
48326	Those outside investors in Coldwell Banker include Carlyle Group , a closely held Washington , D.C. , merchant banking firm whose co-chairman is Frank Carlucci , former secretary of defense ; Frederic V. Malek , senior adviser to Carlyle Group ; Mellon Family Trust of Pittsburgh ; Westinghouse Credit Corp. , the financial services unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp. ; Bankers Trust Co. , a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. ; and a group of Japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of Tokyo-based Sumitomo Bank .
48327	Bankers Trust and Sumitomo financed the $ 300 million acquisition from Sears Roebuck .
48329	The nominees are Gary Wilson , chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co. ; James Montgomery , chief executive officer of Great Western Financial Corp. ; and Peter Ubberroth , former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor .
48330	The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
48331	Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
48335	Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge .
48340	The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .
48341	But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .
48342	Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges .
48343	Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
48347	`` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor .
48350	After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went into effect .
48353	But the 250-point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered .
48354	The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies .
48356	The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .
48357	In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .
48358	Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions .
48359	In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets .
48361	At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill .
48362	There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . ''
48363	And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .
48365	Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .
48367	The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
48368	In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .
48369	After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
48375	-- If S&P futures fall 12 points -LRB- equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher .
48376	On NYSE program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .
48377	-- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher .
48379	S&P and MMI contracts also halt .
48381	Trading in MMI and S&P futures also halted .
48385	-- Make margins consistent across stock and futures markets
48393	-- Create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws .
48395	`` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' Nikolai I. Lutsenko , the president of the Nika TV company , told the weekly newspaper Nedelya .
48396	The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said .
48405	Tsuruo Yamaguchi , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen -LRB- about $ 55,000 -RRB- but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry .
48406	The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders .
48410	Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success .
48416	China 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .
48417	The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .
48419	The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . ''
48425	It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children .
48426	`` It is almost identical to the Sony product , '' Mr. Iken remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures .
48429	The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return .
48433	Seeking to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law .
48442	`` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , '' says Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube .
48445	At worst , he adds , `` They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away . ''
48446	Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace .
48447	`` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says .
48449	The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
48453	Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored .
48454	With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios .
48457	Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children .
48460	Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor .
48461	His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .
48462	Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors .
48464	By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed .
48465	Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April .
48466	He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department .
48471	Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court .
48472	And Justin , in a news release , says , `` Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong-arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets . ''
48480	They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . ''
48482	@ Charles H. Tenney II , chairman of Unitil Corp. , purchased 34,602 shares , or 4.9 % , of Unitil 's common , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
48484	As previously reported , Unitil , Exeter , N.H. , and Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co. , Fitchburg , Mass. , are targets of unsolicited tender offers from Boston-based Eastern Utilities Associates .
48485	Eastern Utilities has offered $ 40 a share for Unitil and $ 36 a share for Fitchburg Gas and has extended both offers to Dec. 4 .
48491	The Societe Generale banking group controls 18.2 % of the shareholding , while Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. owns 9.69 % and Financiere Tradition , a holding company , owns 5.1 % .
48493	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Rocha Garza said Biscayne Syndicate Inc. , Lahus II Inc. , and Lahus III Inc. bought the 600,000 shares on Oct. 11 for $ 1.4 million , or $ 2.375 a share .
48494	Mr. Rocha Garza said that he , Clarendon Group Ltd. , Biscayne , Lahus II , and Lahus III are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of 1,234,100 shares , or 9.33 % .
48497	Investcorp , New York , said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10-store Sports Unlimited chain for some $ 40 million .
48498	The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation , a 10-year-old sporting goods retailer , said Oliver E. Richardson , a member of Investcorp 's management committee and a director of the chain .
48500	The company is `` very profitable '' on an operating basis , Mr. Richardson said , but he declined to specify numbers .
48501	In 1982 , Sports & Recreation 's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie , Ill .
48505	Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity , an Irvine , Calif. , title-insurance underwriter , are continuing , but that prospects for a longer-term standstill agreement are uncertain .
48507	Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement .
48509	Giant , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman , did n't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline , and Aspen officials could n't be reached for comment .
48512	The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies , which are involved in making cement , recycling newsprint and operating fast-food restaurants .
48514	Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas .
48515	Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks .
48516	AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise .
48519	The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers , with a total value of $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion , between 1994 and 2004 .
48522	Under the agreement with Lockheed , Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB-339 jet tandem-trainer and will supply certain structures .
48523	Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its Marietta , Ga. , plant should the Air Force order the craft .
48526	But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills .
48529	The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman .
48530	Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job-rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
48531	The market for $ 200 billion of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday .
48534	`` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
48544	Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale .
48545	Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money .
48547	`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
48552	In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year .
48560	Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , Abbett & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high-yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- .
48562	He adds : `` The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk .
48563	I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that people are running scared .
48564	There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . ''
48568	First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments .
48569	`` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says Mr. Carleton of First Boston .
48571	`` When the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will .
48576	`` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six .
48580	`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch .
48585	-- In July , Southmark Corp. , the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law .
48586	-- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points .
48588	-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities .
48592	`` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market .
48600	The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market .
48603	Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession .
48604	Prices of municipals , investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts .
48608	But the yield spread between lower-quality , investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened .
48609	And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority .
48611	One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . ''
48614	Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .
48616	The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .
48629	But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .
48631	James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids .
48633	So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points .
48634	Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .
48640	They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays .
48644	There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington .
48647	The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries .
48648	The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations .
48652	Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million .
48654	Interest income and most fee income was strong .
48656	For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .
48659	On the other , the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left .
48661	The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates .
48664	With regard to Greece 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece .
48666	He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points .
48667	Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity .
48668	Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched .
48671	In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to PASOK , not clinching proof .
48672	On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members .
48673	Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .
48674	The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .
48675	The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively .
48676	Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services rendered .
48677	So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .
48679	First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .
48682	For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis .
48683	Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .
48689	Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the clock is running .
48691	The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister .
48692	The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
48697	New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .
48700	But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .
48704	Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery .
48705	Friday 's sell-off was triggered by the collapse of UAL 's buy-out plan and a big rise in producer prices .
48707	The junk bond market came to a standstill , while Treasury bonds soared and the dollar fell .
48708	Japanese stocks dropped early Monday , but by late morning were turning around .
48711	Many banks refused to back the $ 6.79 billion transaction , but bankers said it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers .
48713	The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines , but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9 % jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation .
48715	A capital-gains tax cut was removed from the Senate 's deficit reduction bill , but proponents still hope to enact the cut this year .
48718	U.S. car and truck sales fell 12.6 % in early October , the first sales period of the 1990-model year , dragged down by a sharp decline in GM sales .
48719	Warner and Sony are entangled in a legal battle over movie producers Peter Gruber and Jon Peters .
48721	Hooker 's U.S. unit received a $ 409 million bid for most of its real-estate and shopping-center assets from an investor group .
48722	The offer does n't include Bonwit Teller or B. Altman .
48726	British Aerospace and France 's Thomson-CSF are nearing a pact to merge guided-missile divisions .
48729	Four ailing S&Ls were sold off by government regulators , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth .
48739	According to the suit , Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year .
48748	Lawyers are worried about the ruling 's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the Apple case .
48749	`` The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements , '' said Patrick Grannon , a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles , which was n't involved in the case .
48750	`` The court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders . ''
48758	Harvey D. Myerson , of Myerson & Kuhn , then of Finley , Kumble , Wagner , Heine , Underberg , Manley , Myerson & Casey , was the lead trial lawyer , and his new firm pursued the application appeal .
48761	The federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the USFL from being reimbursed .
48763	But Shepard Goldfein , an attorney for the NFL , says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court .
48764	Mr. Goldfein , of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom in New York , says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the USFL lost its major claims , including its contention that the NFL restrained trade through television contracts .
48767	Fulbright & Jaworski of Houston and Fenerty , Robertson , Fraser & Hatch of Calgary , Alberta , are affiliating to help serve their energy-industry clients .
48769	The firms are n't required to refer work exclusively to each other and remain separate organizations .
48770	But they will work together on energy - , environmental - and fair-trade-related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest , said Gibson Gayle Jr. of 585-lawyer Fulbright & Jaworski .
48772	The arrangement , reached after about eight months of negotiations , grew out of 80-lawyer Fenerty Robertson 's desire to develop ties with a U.S. firm in light of relaxed trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada , said Francis M. Saville of Fenerty Robertson .
48774	Mount Lebanon High School , near Pittsburgh , sought $ 21 million in compensatory damages from Grace , arguing that the asbestos , which can cause respiratory diseases and lung cancer , posed a risk to students .
48776	A spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the plaintiff was a school and the asbestos in question was used for fireproofing .
48783	Mr. Magurno , 45 , spent 17 years at the Miami airline unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp. and was named general counsel in 1984 .
48785	Mr. Magurno said he will split his time between the 200-lawyer firm 's offices in Washington , D.C. , and New York , with specialties in aviation and labor law .
48787	Apple will offer a $ 150 rebate on its Apple IIGS with any Apple Monitor and disk drive ; $ 200 on the basic Macintosh Plus central processing unit ; $ 250 on the Macintosh SE central processing unit ; $ 250 on the Macintosh SE\/30 cpu , and $ 300 on a Macintosh IIcx with any Apple video card and Apple monitor .
48789	The company is also offering a free trial of its computers to consumers who qualify for its credit cards or leases .
48790	Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced they have completed a 100 million-mark -LRB- $ 52.2 million -RRB- joint venture to produce electronics parts .
48791	In the venture 's first fiscal year , Siemens will hold 74.9 % of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary , Matsushita Electronic Components Co. , 25.1 % .
48795	Matsushita 's share in the venture will rise to 35 % Oct. 1 , 1990 , and to 50 % the following Oct. 1 .
48799	The company will have production facilities in West Germany , Austria , France and Spain .
48801	Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington .
48803	In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly .
48804	But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , U.S. News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation .
48805	Mortimer B. Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief , said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , the magazine 's executive editor , and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer .
48806	Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other .
48807	Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to articles .
48811	Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit-sharing soared 97 % to 839 million francs -LRB- $ 129.6 million -RRB- in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier .
48816	The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full-year earnings .
48817	Keystone Consolidated Industries Inc. expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of about $ 1.5 million , or about 41 cents a share , for the third quarter , compared with a loss last year , said Glenn R. Simmons , chairman and chief executive officer .
48818	After a tax benefit of about $ 780,000 , Keystone expects to report net income of $ 2.3 million , or about 62 cents a share , Mr. Simmons said .
48819	For third quarter last year , Keystone reported a $ 1 million loss from continuing operations and a $ 200,000 loss from discontinued operations , for a net loss of $ 1.2 million .
48821	Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced , imported steel .
48822	A new $ 46 million steel rod minimill , which got off to a rocky start in early 1988 , now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing Keystone 's products , Mr. Simmons said .
48823	As a result , the company hopes to report net income for the year of about $ 11.6 million , or about $ 3.10 to $ 3.15 a share , compared with a net loss of $ 24.4 million last year , after a loss from discontinued operations of $ 18.4 million .
48825	For the nine months ended Sept. 30 , Keystone expects to report net income of $ 9.3 milion , or about $ 2.53 a share , after an extraordinary gain from $ 3.2 million in tax benefits .
48826	Last year , the company had a net loss of $ 6.5 million , including a $ 6.1 million loss from continuing operations and a $ 400,000 loss from discontinued operations .
48829	Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone 's casting operation to supply it , he said , which will force Keystone to purchase billet , or unfinished steel bars , from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year .
48831	Under Robert W. Singer , who was named president and chief operating officer last year , Keystone has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the East and West coasts .
48833	Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers , '' Mr. Simmons said .
48834	Still , he said , the 100-year-old company plans to continue its premium-priced strategy for its distinctive brand of red-tipped wire fencing and other products .
48835	The company claims a 40 % share of the U.S. field fence business , a 35 % share of poultry netting sales and a 30 % share of barbed wire sales .
48836	Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium-recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit .
48838	The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves .
48845	Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human-sounding -- voice announce , `` I am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a 15-second discourse on its own attributes .
48846	The talking chip is n't cheap -- the per-ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes it is a first .
48847	Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services .
48851	The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt .
48852	Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank-credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 .
48854	Lomas said Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor .
48855	It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company .
48857	Don Bowder , senior vice president and chief accountant , said the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$ 1.17 billion in non-Mexican LDC debt .
48859	The bank said about C$ 525 million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending Oct. 31 .
48861	The bank 's net income for the nine months ended July 31 was C$ 577 million , or C$ 3.10 a share .
48863	The bank has a 45 % reserve against the remaining C$ 349 million of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds .
48864	Mr. Bowder said the bank 's experience with LDC debt has been `` painful '' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning , debt sales and debt swaps .
48865	He said the bank will no longer participate in LDC sovereign lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank 's standards .
48867	Suitors from now on are more likely to be expansion-minded companies , rather than raiders or debt-happy financiers .
48868	And they will be launching lower-priced and perhaps fewer deals , now that it 's tougher to finance them .
48869	This is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale .
48873	`` I look at where deals can get done , '' he says , `` and they 're not getting done '' at current prices .
48875	`` You had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran smack into the news on Friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market , '' says Steven Rattner , a partner and merger specialist with Lazard Freres & Co .
48880	Takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any UAL developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy .
48881	Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL 's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks .
48883	Trading in AMR shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Friday and did n't resume .
48886	Similarly , Delta Air Lines and USAir Group dropped 10.1 % and 8.5 % , respectively , on Friday and could weaken further .
48887	Over the weeked , however , two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies .
48890	For the broader market , the greatest significance of the Vitro-Anchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $ 139 million loan from Security Pacific National Bank .
48891	Moreover , to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt , Donaldson said it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for Vitro , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market .
48895	McCaw is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares , thereby challenging LIN 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ 20-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with BellSouth 's cellular business .
48896	On Friday , LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 1\/2 .
48897	Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were n't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers .
48903	`` In the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which were often prepared to outbid '' the corporations , says J. Tomilson Hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
48905	Many takeover stocks plunged Friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks , the targets of rumored deals .
48907	But several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell 10 % or more .
48908	They include USX , down 11.7 % ; Upjohn , down 11.1 % ; Campbell Soup , down 11 % ; Paramount Communications , off 10.3 % ; Woolworth , down 10.2 % ; Delta Air Lines , down 10.1 % , and MCA , down 9.7 % .
48909	The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already .
48910	Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again .
48913	Ramada , which first delayed and then shelved a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\/2 .
48914	Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so .
48915	Shares of American Medical International , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago , fell 15.8 % on Friday to close at 20 .
48919	Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses .
48921	However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers .
48923	William Lebo , Hilton 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . ''
48925	But the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers , both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks .
48929	Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
48930	To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
48932	Specifically , it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
48934	In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
48935	This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .
48938	Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
48939	Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
48940	Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % .
48944	Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 .
48945	Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?
48946	Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation .
48947	Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play .
48949	Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .
48950	In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .
48953	The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant .
48960	More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .
48967	Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- .
48968	The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .
48971	Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport .
48972	When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .
48973	What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?
48974	Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles .
48976	Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .
48977	Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term -LRB- three-year -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .
48979	Kysor Industrial Corp. said it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago .
48980	Analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share .
48984	Kysor , a maker of heavy-duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .
48985	Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him .
48986	Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency .
48987	Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
48991	According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''
48993	The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''
48995	Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day .
48996	The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 .
49002	In addition , Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's vacation home at Cat Cay , the Bahamas , from 1984 through 1986 .
49003	Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . ''
49004	Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts .
49006	`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls .
49007	In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''
49008	In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year .
49013	Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''
49014	Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent .
49015	Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . ''
49016	Sen. DeConcini said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . ''
49026	The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony .
49029	The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies .
49030	`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd .
49031	Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre .
49033	By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say .
49035	A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site .
49038	In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion -LRB- US$ 1.29 billion -RRB- .
49042	`` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border .
49043	In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia .
49044	Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting .
49045	Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied .
49046	With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites .
49047	Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc .
49048	Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .
49049	The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
49050	Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games .
49052	Introduced in mid-1988 , the 15-centimeter-tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series .
49058	Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year .
49062	Also , concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms .
49063	But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern China .
49064	They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong .
49065	`` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. Kwan of Playmates .
49069	The administration 's position was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term .
49074	On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .
49076	Aluminum Co. of America , hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas , said net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2 % to $ 219 million , or $ 2.46 a share .
49077	The nation 's No. 1 aluminum maker earned $ 226.3 million , or $ 2.56 a share , a year earlier .
49081	Much of the earnings decline was led by currency-exchange rate adjustments , which affected the bottom line by $ 15.3 million , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million , or four cents a share , the previous year .
49082	Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said .
49084	Excluding the higher tax rate , which rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said R. Wayne Atwell , an analyst with Goldman , Sachs & Co .
49089	For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business .
49090	And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that .
49092	They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .
49093	Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon .
49094	And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin-syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .
49100	And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , to look for ways of skirting the fin-syn regulations .
49101	But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios .
49105	Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends .
49107	Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed .
49114	Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise .
49116	The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .
49118	In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin-syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises .
49126	With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington .
49138	Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged .
49141	The networks and studios have bickered ever since .
49142	Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely .
49143	In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue .
49145	But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own .
49148	The government sued the company in April , seeking $ 23,000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract-steering scheme .
49149	The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company .
49150	The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss , an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors , to accept $ 23,000 in bribes , kickbacks and gratuities .
49151	Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11,000 for his role in the scheme .
49152	In the agreement , Recognition agreed to pay the government $ 20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company , Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy .
49154	A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia .
49155	They were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment .
49156	The company and its executives deny the charges .
49158	The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since .
49161	The big semiconductor and computer maker , said it had net of $ 72 million , or 38 cents , down 50 % from $ 142.7 million , or 78 cents a share .
49165	Intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday , as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ 99.3 million , or 53 cents a share , and that sales actually exceeded the $ 747.3 million for the second period .
49167	In August , Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor , start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new 80486 chip in the current quarter .
49168	On Friday , Andrew S.Grove , Intel president and chief executive officer , said `` Intel 's business is strong .
49169	Our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and September was especially good .
49170	For the full quarter , our bookings were higher than the previous quarter , and our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.0 . ''
49171	For the nine-month period , Intel reported net of $ 268.3 million , or $ 1.43 a share , down 27 % from $ 367.1 million , or $ 2.05 a share .
49173	Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday .
49175	At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country .
49176	And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .
49177	A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves .
49178	At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons .
49182	Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .
49183	But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .
49188	Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle .
49189	And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .
49191	President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .
49192	But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
49193	As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .
49194	As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency .
49195	If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest .
49196	If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .
49198	The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars .
49199	Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
49200	In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .
49202	The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so-called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action .
49207	`` We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us .
